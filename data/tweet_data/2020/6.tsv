T-cell response works best against the whole viral diversity. This raises the question whether there should not be more efforts towards 'traditional' vaccines (i.e. attenuated/inactivated).(12/13)	2020	06
2020-06-30 08:44:04	BallouxFrancois	1113747629282930688	1277885605528121344	While there is still no established case of #SARSCoV2 reinfection to date, it is likely those will be observed soon due to fairly fast waning antibodies. Though, anyone with a prior exposure to #SARSCoV2 is expected to experience far less severe symptoms upon reinfection.(11/13)	2020	06

There is also evidence for widespread cross-immunity with 'common cold' coronaviruses.(8/13)	2020	06

The main reasons are that T-cell response is less straightforward to measure and it is generally considered less important for vaccine efficacy.(6/13)	2020	06

As such, antibody tests can fail to detect prior infection in particular for asymptomatic or mild infections. Serological surveys may underestimate the proportion of people infected.(5/13)	2020	06
2020-06-30 08:44:02	BallouxFrancois	1113747629282930688	1277885595499536384	Antibodies are fairly easy to quantify which is the basis of serological tests that inform whether someone has been infected with #SARSCoV2.

Until recently, all the attention in the #SARSCoV2 debate has been on antibodies.(3/13)	2020	06

Innate immunity represents mostly first-line responses with no memory of prior infections. Acquired immunity can be broken down into 'antibody-mediated' and 'T-cell-mediated' immunity.(2/13)	2020	06

2020-06-26 21:55:02	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635106636189696	Although I was just a teenager loading gels in a makeshift lab, my involvement in the Human Genome Project has always been something that's shaped my scientific career. It's inspiring to know that ludicrous projects that go at a snail's pace to begin with can accelerate so fast.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:02	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635104987828225	I think I even got that grade back the same week that Clinton announced the project had been a success. 20 years ago today. So I was confident that I at least wrote about some worthy automation.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:02	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635103343579136	I wrote my final year essay on 'automation in genome sequencing' based on the visit. It was amazing to research how things had changed and dive into the automation and technology. My advisor Ed Southern (of blotting fame) hated it and gave me a 2:2 grade. I still don't know why.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:01	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635101561045000	At the start of 2000, I paid a visit back to the Sanger Institute to see how it had changed. It was now a huge place with DNA code flying past on LED screens. It was unrecognisable - rooms and rooms of robots and new sequencers. The same sequencing methods, but industrialised.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:01	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635099883360256	It was just simply a case of taking proven methods, optimising them, automating and scaling like crazy. The world had never seen something like this in biology before, and nothing has come close since. It's pretty amazing to look back on.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:00	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635098092384260	Sanger sequencing and ABIs still were the workhorses, but switching from slab to capillary sequencing helped the automation, read length and quality. The shotgun method of sequencing certainly made the workflow a lot easier, but couldn't be relied on for gap-less assemblies.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:00	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635096443953154	But only 5 years later and it was done! I'd only just had time to finish my biochem degree (it was my final week) and somehow 3.2 billion bp had been read. What's craziest of all is that they didn't really change much since I loaded my gels - they just scaled and automated.	2020	06
2020-06-26 21:55:00	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1276635095101734912	I remember thinking how ludicrous this project was. More than 3 billion bases and we were pipetting every 500 bp read by hand into these annoying gels! It was cool to be involved but it felt it would take a decade more at least.	2020	06

In sum, we believe that using dynamics can give us interesting insights into the development and nature of adversarial examples.	2020	06

This result also holds for nonlinear models, where the increase in expressive power amplifies these differences. https://t.co/5kePsyBl1k	2020	06
2020-06-25 20:44:21	josueortc	40238805	1276254929322217472	9/n Furthermore, we found that the convolutional operation (Bounded-Width Convolution),via translation invariance, produces models with higher frequency adversarial perturbations, as compared to the other models. This is the case even when all the models have the same performance https://t.co/KU10k51IPi	2020	06

2020-06-25 20:44:20	josueortc	40238805	1276254923232096256	7/n We confirmed this theory, via training fully connected and full-width convolutional models on CIFAR-10, where we observed that the latter have sparser adversarial perturbation spectra. https://t.co/ugeu0ic9tv	2020	06
2020-06-25 20:44:19	josueortc	40238805	1276254922133159936	6/n For this we used theory develop by Gunasekar et al 2019, where they found that full width convolutional linear models induce an L1 implicit regularizer in the Fourier spectrum of the end-to-end linear predictor,  compared to an L2 regularizer in fully connected linear models.	2020	06
2020-06-25 20:44:19	josueortc	40238805	1276254921227149317	5/n Then, we asked: is the high-frequency structure in adversarial examples only due to the dataset? Or is it also dependent on the model parametrization via the Implicit Regularization? We explored this first in linear models.	2020	06
2020-06-25 20:44:18	josueortc	40238805	1276254917934698496	4/n In addition, we found that in a ResNet Model trained on CIFAR-10, there is a dynamical evolution from low to high frequencies in the adversarial perturbations.  The small figures show the average 2D Fourier spectrum of the adversarial perturbations as a function of training. https://t.co/fXvm2rZ2iP	2020	06

2020-06-23 02:29:23	soychicka	15271133	1275254597939073025	So those dildos strip away the veneer, unmasking the pure, raw, venal horrors that has been the ultimate driver of most of the predation on those with less power throughout time.And where dildos are not an option, vegetable peelers should get the message across too.	2020	06

2020-06-23 02:29:20	soychicka	15271133	1275254585163210752	It's still rape of boys and girls, men and women, for fun and profit.It's still tethering one's existence to the whims of another, no matter if it's chains or passports that bind.It's still the annexation of one's very soul, the drawing + quartering of human rights.	2020	06
2020-06-23 02:29:20	soychicka	15271133	1275254584131403780	But why dildos?  Slavery is the most vile abuse of power, subsuming the humanity and existence of imprisoned children, women and men to those slavers who, regardless of their contributions to society, were subhuman.It's not over.

Though, some endemic flu seasons can occasionally be locally severe. The 1951 'endemic' flu season in the UK/Canada caused excess deaths on the 1918/19 scale.(5/6)https://t.co/1X1l8PPChJ https://t.co/o47fYmZcRN	2020	06

2020-06-15 08:54:58	TwelveSharp	519952673	1272452527120953344	Do you ever think for a minute how far technology has gone? 20 years ago, we had to spend 3 billion dollars to get *one* human genome sequenced. Now, we have access to the transcriptome of *single* cells, or the complete genome of *thousands* of individuals	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:54:00	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452283758977025	"Finally, a plea again for solidarity - this a ""humans vs the virus"" situation - it is not about countries, less so even groups inside a country. Very simply we want to eliminate the virus or live comfortably alongside it. We should stay focused on that goal."	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452282672693249	"The diversity of companies and diversity of approaches means we have many ""shots on goal"". Again, no guarentee one will work, but we have got to be happy at the rate of progress of the vaccines."	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452281565425664	4. Finally there are a large number of vaccines in the pipeline with earliest in Phase III trials now (I am actually in the trial, going for my randomised dose of Oxford vaccine or Meningitis tomorrow).	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452280520974341	Large, well powered, adaptive trials are the way forward here. Negative results is depressing but they remove the endless opportunity cost of wondering what could work and focus us on the cases that might.	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452279434690561	3. We have well powered clinical trials coming in; I am a particular fan of the UK's RECOVERY trial. It is nailed down for example that one drug (HCQ) does not change the course of the disease. Other drugs are progressing through the trials.	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:58	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452278281256961	We should be in a position to watch the virus far more closely than before and identify any incipient outbreaks/clusters (a key part of the Japanese strategy as well).	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:58	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452277140414465	The near future is positive for testing respiratory virus panels (going to be v. useful in autumn/winter when other colds and flu come back) and testing pooled resources for surveillance - Sewage in particular could be really useful.	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:58	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452276096045056	No matter what the technology used, testing capacity is going to go up - we will need to focus on other areas of bottlenecking here - people/swab/spit logistics. Again, operationalising this is complex, but doable.	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:58	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452274971979776	2. Testing levels are higher + I hope will go higher still. I have a whopping conflict of interest here, as one of the next-scale testing technologies is @nanopore's LamPORE which is undergoing final trials before regulatory submission. I am a long established consultant to ONT	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:57	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452273839509505	(It is one thing to see this aggregate response, and another thing to learn, operationalise and implement them in another location, but it is doable. Humans can live alongside this virus).	2020	06
2020-06-15 08:53:57	ewanbirney	183548902	1272452272727953410	1. A number of countries have reasonably light rules with still active infections - South Korea and Japan stand out for me. This suggests a subset of non-pharmaceutical interventions - rules of behaviour - can dramatically reduce transmission rates.	2020	06

2020-06-08 09:59:40	jeromekelleher	2233451359	1269932096941940736	Finally, I want to apologise. I made the error in the OOA model, and I should have checked it more carefully. Msprime users have been affected, and I'm truly sorry for this. Documentation examples will be tested with the same rigor as library code in the future.	2020	06
2020-06-08 09:59:40	jeromekelleher	2233451359	1269932095251656704	Thanks to my coathors @SFGravel, Dom Nelson and @apragsdale for getting this together so quickly. Particularly and especially to Aaron, for finding the OOA bug in the first place and then analysing it so thoroughly.	2020	06
2020-06-08 09:59:39	jeromekelleher	2233451359	1269932093481648130	There are two major lessons for me: (1) we *really* need stdpopsim. Defining these simulation models is hard, and they should not be reimplemented over and over. (2) we need better tools. Msprime's demography API is not easy enough to use, and we're working to fix that.	2020	06
2020-06-08 09:59:39	jeromekelleher	2233451359	1269932092256915456	The OOA model has now been fixed in stdpopsim (version 0.1.2) and msprime's documentation. We have tried to identify copies of the faulty model and contacted the owners to alert them.  See here for more details: https://t.co/X6AmES3PP0	2020	06

2020-06-03 14:43:18	yimmieg	609365987	1268191535151017987	8/8: Most of checkpoint inhibition is focused on reinvigorating CD8s. Pretty excited about cytotoxic CD4s as another axis of antitumor immunity and exploring how the incredible phenotypic diversity/plasticity of CD4s can be leveraged for therapy.	2020	06
2020-06-03 14:43:18	yimmieg	609365987	1268191533599059971	7/8: Cyto CD4s have historically been dismissed as artifacts of cell culture. Recently, there has been renewed interest in their role in antiviral response. They have also been described in other cancers and bear some resemblance to peripheral helper T cells in autoimmunity.	2020	06
2020-06-03 14:43:17	yimmieg	609365987	1268191532391165954	6/8: A gene expression signature specific to cyto CD4s is associated with response to checkpoint blockade in an independent bulk RNA-seq dataset.	2020	06
2020-06-03 14:43:17	yimmieg	609365987	1268191531078279169	5/8: To validate their function, we co-cultured cyto CD4s with autologous bladder tumor cells in vitro, and showed they can kill tumor in a MHC II dependent way that appears to be partially inhibited by Tregs. Cyto CD4s kill slower than CD8s but not by much. https://t.co/jKJEfthOI1	2020	06
2020-06-03 14:43:16	yimmieg	609365987	1268191527550849025	4/8: Cyto CD4s are also clonally expanded based on TCR sequencing (to do this...we had to build a custom amplification strategy off of the @10xGenomics 3' V1 full-length libraries and got ~50% recovery of paired TCRA/TCRB sequences.) https://t.co/CrA5fVxCHX	2020	06

2020-06-03 14:43:15	yimmieg	609365987	1268191524006723584	3/8: What was surprising is we also found multiple cytotoxic CD4 populations. Cyto CD4s are distinguished by the expression of GZMK and GZMB and they are very similar transcriptionally to analogous CD8 T cell populations. https://t.co/dgcsPp8aiM	2020	06
2020-06-03 14:43:14	yimmieg	609365987	1268191518994526209	2/8: We used single cell RNA/TCR-sequencing to characterize ~30k tumor infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells. CD4s are more abundant and primarily consist of two populations of regulatory T cells (IL25hi and IL25lo). These Tregs are clonally expanded and do not appear to be induced. https://t.co/Kr20d1WSbD	2020	06
