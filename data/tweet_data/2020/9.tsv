Then I can put up a tarp &amp; limit any more water from being added.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:59:01	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455541575680000	So we had to wrap before we finished the story, but we had a wrap-up session before everyone got slammed with professorships and vet school. I got to tell them what they were missing out on and answer questions. It was amazing! Not a bad first go tbh; 12/12 https://t.co/xolSFJRzw6	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:58	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455531022848005	Another major highlight was that I had a bout of writer's block, so I hopped on @cconowitch's Ko-Fi, and she masterfully filled that part in for me (and helped with a lot of other stuff too!). 10/10 would recommend! I also got to use @FantasyEcology's Hell Swarm, which I loved.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:58	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455529584275459	I also didn't have a proper backstory for an important story element, so I designed a smaller campaign around it and let 4 other brand-new D&amp;D players write it for me by being the party in the story. Wrapped everything up in a tight little bow for me! They are on Session 11 now.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:58	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455528346955776	Favorite mechanic I wrote in was an army of Sand Golems moving about the map that would sack cities based on their time spent on side quests. They had no idea it was happening and it had a pretty big impact on the story.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:57	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455527008960512	Anyway, highlights! Favorite NPC was CL3R1C (called Claire): a solar-powered warforged druid who ran a sun-worshiping temple. Favorite magic item I made: Bag of Hole-ding, a BoH they got in a joke shop that slips their stuff btw/ pocket dimensions based on rolls.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:57	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455525704523781	The players, 2 brand new to D&amp;D and two who had played before, will average 1 PhD-level degree each once our Rogue wraps her DVM/PhD program. The DM does not have a PhD, but was in charge anyway. Who wasted whose time now?? It was an amazing group.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:57	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455523926138884	It was an island surrounded by impassable magic sand with lots of history for the players to largely ignore at their leisure. Storm sorcerers I called the Engineers were responsible for maintaining storms and keeping the river flowing (ecosystem engineers? anyone?). https://t.co/1vQM5fcIdm	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:53	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455508784656384	I'd never built a map before, so I turned to my usual muse for creativity: beer. The outline was beer foam and the features were more different beer foam. I inverted them, superimposed, and used @inkarnaterpg to turn it into a real fake place. https://t.co/FQd9Wvhw7t	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:50	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455496197607426	So imagine a young, gray-skinned Aasimar woman with a frilly green dress and a Solar at her side (which had to modify because the party wasn't nearly high enough level for one, but I liked the joke). Then I built the world around her!	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:50	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455494813384704	Like the eastern emerald elysia, Elyse drew her power from the sun. Through a process called kleptoplasty, E. chlorotica incorporates chloroplasts from some of the algae, etc. it eats and can properly photosynthesize, so it's on a short list of animals with such power.	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:49	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455492456226818	I designed the whole campaign around a character I based off one of my favorite animals. Elyse was an Aasimar Cleric in flowing green robes that loved to steal artifacts of power and use them for herself. She was based off of a sea slug, Elysia chlorotica. https://t.co/gV6c6gixXW	2020	09
2020-09-30 23:58:49	IndoorEcology	2272197025	1311455490719834114	I just finished my first #dnd5e campaign I ever DM'd this weekend!

Though, it remains somewhat unsatisfactory. Better, larger and well-controlled studies are urgently needed.(5/5)	2020	09

2020-09-21 10:58:25	s_wuyts	180829697	1307997607583678466	So in short. For fermented carrots we found that:1) Fermentation is really good for outcompeting nasty pathogens but please ferment long enough2)  Mixing with unpasteurised juices later can be a risk!	2020	09
2020-09-21 10:58:25	s_wuyts	180829697	1307997606258315264	We found that storage of mixed juices under refrigeration cannot be relied upon as a safety measure ‚õîÔ∏è. It is recommended to use pasteurised juices for addition to the fermented juice, to reduce the likelihood of exposure to food borne pathogens.	2020	09
2020-09-21 10:58:25	s_wuyts	180829697	1307997604840693762	And what if you want to mix your ferment with another freshly juiced vegetable, like cucumberü•í juice?Good idea, it tastes nice. But be aware, if your cucumber juice would be contaminated with pathogens, and you mix it with the fermented juice, your protective effect is gone.	2020	09
2020-09-21 10:58:24	s_wuyts	180829697	1307997603406192643	Yes they are! ‚úÖIf you add food pathogens prior to the fermentation, they start to grow at the beginning, but get completely wiped out after at least 9 days of fermentation. ‚û°Ô∏è Good news, but please ferment long enough to make sure all bad boys are gone.	2020	09
2020-09-21 10:58:24	s_wuyts	180829697	1307997601908879360	This makes it a good model system! More about that in one of my main PhD articles:https://t.co/2gXikPLAGO@vanbeeckw continued this work and wondered whether these fermentations are also good at keeping food-borne pathogens ‚ò£Ô∏è away if they are added to the fermentation?	2020	09
2020-09-21 10:58:23	s_wuyts	180829697	1307997599199301633	At the @SarahLebeer lab we really like spontaneous carrot juice fermentations, because they are easy to set up and to maintain. Moreover, even without addition of a starter culture they are fairly repeatable, meaning that in every fermentation a very similar community emerges. https://t.co/z1AmrvLw6O	2020	09

2020-09-20 14:56:27	ewanbirney	183548902	1307695121966813185	The tendency though is to ignore the risk to transmission side.

Low risk persons can be tested later in life, less frequently, or not at all. High risk persons can be tested earlier or more often.	2020	09

Hereditary cancer testing, which is based on your individual predisposition to cancer(s) as determined by mutations you inherited (e.g. TP53, BRCA1/2, etc.), is a HUGE determinant of cancer risk.	2020	09

Intuitively, screening 100,000 people aged 65+ will result in better outcomes and economics than screening 100,000 teenagers. Why?Cancer incidence increases with age.	2020	09

2020-09-04 22:29:38	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010962661322752	The development of vaccines have gone far far faster than anyone expected (I have been on a Phase II/III trial for the Oxford vaccine since the summer); more vaccines are being made and at a faster rate than ever expected.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:38	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010961457537024	Q: So - is there a plan?A: Broadly yes, though one does have to piece it together. The main plan in most European countries, UK included, is have enough control of viral transmission until there is a good enough vaccine for the at risk (elderly) population.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:37	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010960299819009	Q: This is not going to work well when it is rainingA: Agreed	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:37	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010958643179520	Q: So we shouldn't go to pubs? Or clubs?A: Beer gardens / outside seem fine. Inside - keep the windows open, wash everything obsessively and get back outside. Personally I think it's just best not to go to clubs.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:37	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010957326098439	The main concern though is that schools and universities going back means lots of potential new and more contact patterns - basically, teenagers + young adults going to pubs and clubs, adults going work place + pubs. More contacts, more at risky locations	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:36	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010956059377664	Q: Why are people so concerned about schools reopening?A: Partly I think it is the unknown and genuine concern, I think unfounded, for risk to children. Partly it is the risk for the staff (though the evidence is thin that teaching staff are more at risk); however &gt;&gt;	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:36	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010954432077825	Q: Is there any risk to my children?A: It is low, and it was low in the holidays when your children were somewhere else (likely ... having ice creams, visiting seaside cafes etc). Children need education and peers - they will be happier and safe in schools.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:36	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010953052098560	Q: Will schools going back increase transmission?A: We don't know. What we do know is that schools going back is also a big shift in contact patterns post holidays - people moving around, more workplace visits, different visits by different people. It is not just about schools.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010951714181120	France the cases have climbed but the hospitalisations have just nudged up. Belgium had a mini 2nd wave outbreak which they tamed by reintroducing local lockdowns and more mask wearing.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010950078394370	Q: So - should I get worried about my friend in Madrid? Or Lyon? Or Sevilla? Other places in Europe?A: If they are young, likely not. If they are old... then location matters. Spain has strong growth of cases and hospitalisation rates have climbed, in particular in Madrid &gt;&gt;	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010948727775232	Sweden's strategy is more nuanced than the headlines make out elsewhere. There was early on a higher acceptance of natural progression of the virus, but in many ways Sweden has ended up in a similar place to much of Europe - low viral transmission due to behavioural changes	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:34	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010947482071042	If we did this at the virus' natural rate it would mean the health systems would have to become dedicated to palliative care for many months as well as just a large number of people dying. &gt;&gt;	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:34	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010946257387522	Q: What about just letting everyone have it at some controlled rate now? Isn't this what Sweden is doing?A: Just letting the virus circulate will mean somewhere around 0.5% (perhaps a little lower) of people dying and many more people having a debilitating disease &gt;&gt;	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:34	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010944546111488	To make a segregation work to be confident that you just let rip in one part of the population without infecting another part you really have to have basically no contact - anywhere, any context, any shop, any school, any hospital and any family. It's basically unfeasible.	2020	09
2020-09-04 22:29:33	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010943262601217	Q: OK. Can't we just let the young people get it, and then they will all be immuneA: Although the rate is higher in the young it is still in the 1 in 1,000 or so (say in France) - there is plenty further it can get to and at some point it will likely go into the older population	2020	09

2020-09-04 22:29:32	ewanbirney	183548902	1302010940146282496	The other thing is that younger people are being less careful (older people have remained careful) so the cases and transmission are happening more in the young, in particular in France and Spain	2020	09

The right chart includes age-at-diagnosis. Interestingly, a very low PRS can be benevolent, rescuing the risk imparted by a dangerous monogenic variant to near baseline.	2020	09
2020-09-03 01:41:26	sbarnettARK	874609260121993216	1301334456100323330	The study showed that the risk imparted by dangerous, monogenic variants could be meaningfully altered by assessing the polygenic background. A high PRS (x-axis) means more risk imparted by the polygenic background signal. Carriers are people w/ dangerous monogenic variants. https://t.co/I0dNq68zkJ	2020	09
2020-09-03 01:41:26	sbarnettARK	874609260121993216	1301334455211171841	One recent (and rigorous) study (Fahed et al.) showed how the combination of monogenic risk (MR) and polygenic risk (PR) could be assessed in parallel. I'm going to summarize the authors' findings and then what I think this means for molecular diagnostic companies.	2020	09

Finally, as I alluded to earlier, the odds ratios for many standalone PRSs is low(er), making them harder for doctors to interpret.	2020	09
2020-09-03 01:41:25	sbarnettARK	874609260121993216	1301334453181198336	Importantly, PRSs have weaker predictive power for non-Europeans since the majority of training data was conducted on Europeans. PRSs don't have the same level of evidence, transparency, or curation. The functional connectivity between variant(s) and diseases is more obscure.	2020	09
2020-09-03 01:41:25	sbarnettARK	874609260121993216	1301334452300374017	Individually, these variants may not mean much, but in aggregate, they could be a powerful signal to predict the penetrance of disease from a patient's genotype. PRSs have been widely used in research settings, but have struggled to gain traction clinically. Why?	2020	09
