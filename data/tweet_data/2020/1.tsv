In effect, the resulting forward model predicts Pf from the ground state (ensemble). 5/	2020	01

Do we (i) aim to find a forward model to predict the protection factor from the ground state, or (ii) do we model the actual state through which exchange occurs? Both are hard problems. 4/	2020	01

Here, consistent means that when the data are calculated from the structure(s) using a forward model, they agree with experiment. 2/	2020	01

A warm thank-you to @BrianPlosky and the team of @MolecularCell for working with us through revisions, accepting the manuscript right before the holidays and publishing so soon thereafter! so happy to see this long project wrapped up	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:25	reimand	208273390	1219303177935360011	16/17 E/ Our FMRE-KO model does not directly reflect SNVs and indels found in patient tumors, and the HEK293 cells originate from non-cancer tissue (embryonic kidney) that does not represent typical cells of patient tumors where the FMRE was identified (kidney RCC and others).	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:25	reimand	208273390	1219303176567959552	15/17 D/ Limited epigenetic, RNA-seq and HiC data restrict the annotation of FMREs. For example, infrequent mutations in FMREs coupled with only partially matched RNA-seq data (~50%) made it challenging to identify mRNA/SNV associations of FMRE target genes.	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:25	reimand	208273390	1219303175741759493	14/17 C/ Variant calls at non-coding regions have technical and biological challenges and biases. To address this, we used high-confidence PCAWG consensus variant calls, filtered some high-suspect regions early, and manually reviewed variants in a subset of top FMREs.	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:25	reimand	208273390	1219303174802112513	13/17 B/ The heterogeneous pan-cancer cohort and our choice of multi-tissue regulatory elements prioritize prediction of pan-cancer candidate drivers and tissue-specific elements probably remain hidden. Even at ~1800 WGS tumors, the dataset appears underpowered.	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:24	reimand	208273390	1219303172054966275	12/17 The study has some important caveats: A/ somatic mutation rates vary across the genome and associate with chromatin state, replication, TF binding, etc., and may raise false flags of positive selection. We attempt to correct for this through a local mutation rate model.	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:23	reimand	208273390	1219303168632348672	11/17 Our study suggests that additional, unexplored non-coding mutations in cancer genomes may as drivers of cancer gene deregulation. In particular, distal regulatory may interact with gene promoters through 3D chromatin to carry out such function.	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:21	reimand	208273390	1219303161552306176	10/17 To wrap, we integrated multiple regulatory elements per gene over a long tail of less-frequent non-coding mutations and found an enrichment of known cancer genes and relevant pathways, suggesting that additional FMREs might be found in larger WGS datasets.	2020	01
2020-01-20 16:58:21	reimand	208273390	1219303160415649792	9/17 These data highlight this FMRE as a distal regulator of CCNB1IP1, while the additional genes and pathways are potentially downstream of this gene. We speculate about a late driver event of senescence or metastasis, but this needs more work of course.	2020	01

In fact they are harmful. There will always be debate on details, but listen to staff if they are nowhere near fitting in tasks in the expected times. (11/14)	2020	01
2020-01-14 07:29:44	jonxhill	208745321	1216985733631815681	@toggl @DrTashaBarlow So are workload models useful? To channel my inner Sir Humphrey Appleby, yes and no. Yes: they provide a rough guide to overall workload in a department. If done well, they can help argue for more resources. But they must be done well. (10/14)	2020	01
2020-01-14 07:29:37	jonxhill	208745321	1216985704527470592	@toggl @DrTashaBarlow My lectures and prep time in WM is 15.32%. I spent 13.95%. I did update lectures and I developed two new practicals using Jupyter notebooks. So the WM does include enough time to keep material up-to-date, but not enought to do a whole module revamp.

I spent a lot of time on research (669 vs 237 hours), with that additional 432 hours unfunded.  (8/14)	2020	01
