2020-08-27 13:13:02	ewanbirney	183548902	1298971787988959232	I appreciate the people who respond on twitter tend to have a beef and an agenda - twitter is *not* a representation of opinion worldwide (thankfully!). But - everyone has to do their part here in this next phase, basically until (hopefully) vaccination of high risk groups.	2020	08
2020-08-27 13:13:02	ewanbirney	183548902	1298971786621661184	Furthermore, given the economic and livelihood impact of the sledgehammer of lockdowns - the only way many countries controlled the earlier infection wave - we should be totally happy to over-engineer - over-test - over-track - over-wear-masks etc.	2020	08
2020-08-27 13:13:01	ewanbirney	183548902	1298971785271050241	Goverments at all levels - national to local, healthsystems and citizens have a lot more options, and are using them. There is no guarantee that they will collectively work but every chance that some combination will.	2020	08
2020-08-27 13:13:01	ewanbirney	183548902	1298971784113516544	Therefore although there is still huge risks of uncontrolled, exponential infection - likely to cause the deaths of 0.5-1% of people and a severe disease for many more - we have more options to control and contain than we could have imagined back in March.	2020	08
2020-08-27 13:13:01	ewanbirney	183548902	1298971782779674625	We have more options on the table in the near term - new tests emerge seemingly every week at the moment, sewage and a level of contact tracing which is at a new level. Vaccines and cures are happening far faster than expected.	2020	08
2020-08-27 13:13:01	ewanbirney	183548902	1298971781521383431	In my view the reality is messier and more complex. The epidemic has no way ended - far from it - but we collectively understand SARS-CoV-2 and its disease, COVID19, far far better than the start of this year.	2020	08

2020-08-25 15:58:31	paigebyerly	3266258420	1298288655635828736	But, these coastal marshes have been carved up by the oil industry &amp; no longer protect the coast like they used to. Now they‚Äôre also sinking with sea level rise. &amp; w climate change, storms are getting worse in intensity, frequency, &amp; duration, &amp; so is inland flooding.

2020-08-25 15:58:22	paigebyerly	3266258420	1298288619187298306	This is bad for many reasons. Obviously, land loss = habitat loss. But also, these marshes act as buffers against storm surge. When coastal areas are flooded from say a giant hurricane, salt marshes absorb a lot of that water &amp; minimize flooding in inland coastal communities. https://t.co/gaU8aCNLe7	2020	08

Louisiana has 40% of the US‚Äôs wetlands &amp; has lost &gt;2k miles of coastal marsh since 1932 (that‚Äôs the size of DELAWARE). We still lose a football field of marsh evey 90 min.

2020-08-13 10:29:01	richardneher	794631618	1293857080626077696	We understand much better now what settings account for most transmission, so we can hopefully contain #SARSCoV2 without drastic restrictions --- but it probably won't be as easy as in summer. We need to act early and should head into winter with as few cases as possible.8/8	2020	08
2020-08-13 10:29:00	richardneher	794631618	1293857078998716417	This is consistent with the pattern of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (given it started 4 months later).To me, this suggests controlling #SARSCoV2 in the Northern Hemisphere will become a lot harder over the next six months and things might spiral out of control quickly.7/8	2020	08
2020-08-13 10:29:00	richardneher	794631618	1293857076796624896	So far:  - Europe and Northern US saw big #SARSCoV2 winter/spring outbreaks. Social distancing (and maybe spring) helped contain them followed by fairly quiet summer - Southern US had a broad peak in summer - South America has large outbreaks in their winter.6/8 https://t.co/g8zSWNxnb4	2020	08
2020-08-13 10:29:00	richardneher	794631618	1293857075106324480	The 2009 H1N1 pandemic had an overall lower R0 and thus seasonal forcing should be more impactful. It also spread rapidly among children, so school holidays likely had a big effect. But even if seasonal effects for #SARSCoV2 are less pronounced, I am still concerned.5/8	2020	08
2020-08-13 10:28:59	richardneher	794631618	1293857072761774081	The UK saw a pattern similar to Northern US; the rest of Europe didn't see much H1N1 until fall -- probably driven by colder weather and the end of summer holidays. Germany saw a transition from middle-aged adults to children over the year (hard to see in the graph).4/8 https://t.co/STr6cPofrN	2020	08
2020-08-13 10:28:58	richardneher	794631618	1293857069641142272	H1N1pdm arrived in many places in spring/early summer, earlier than #SARSCoV2 that started spreading in Dec from central China. With H1N1 in 2009, the North of the US saw distinct spring/summer and fall/winter waves, while the South saw one long peak.3/8 https://t.co/jbtwLhxBem	2020	08

2020-08-06 19:57:39	chrismungall	19600791	1291463467023491072	Additionally, the presence of two overlapping polyproteins with identical sequences up until the frameshift, results in 'pseudo-duplicates', in which parts lists show two entries, where there should in fact be one (e.g. for nsp1 below). 4/n https://t.co/uLuML7qNox	2020	08
2020-08-06 19:57:39	chrismungall	19600791	1291463466239156225	Unfortunately these cleaved products (NSPs in SARSCov2) are not always treated as first-class entities in many databases, even though these are the 'parts' we are most interested in our parts list. For example, there is no entry in NCBI Gene, and no accession in UniProt 3/n	2020	08
2020-08-06 19:57:38	chrismungall	19600791	1291463464850841600	The challenge arises from the existence of viral polyproteins. These are less common in non-viral genomes (but not unheard of - e.g human POMC gene encodes a polyprotein). Each polyprotein is cleaved into multiple discrete functional proteins, as shown below 2/n https://t.co/ncczGnASwk	2020	08

2020-08-04 12:44:59	evolscientist	2319375978	1290629806414016513	So here is a species with genetic diversity as high as a fruit fly, but it is long lived.

2020-08-04 12:15:00	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622262425649154	Situation/surveillance are pointless if you don't have interventions, and the intervention could be bring high capacity testing solutions to a broad location for fine grained case identification.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:15:00	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622261091852288	It is not perfect; there is a host of issues on extraction and points of sampling; the sewage network does not reach and/or cannot be easily sampled anywhere near the whole population, though the most at risk broad area (urban) are likely to be biased towards ease of sampling	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:15:00	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622259858747392	Here sewage needs to be considered as part of a surveillance / situational awareness scheme (along with cases across a country). The passive nature of sewage (people really don't have to change their habits at all) and large scale pooling means this is just excellent	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622258323640327	The other big card to play is early, passive detection via Sewage. There is increasing evidence worldwide that the viral RNA is detectable in Sewage (thankfully it looks mainly deactivated by stomach acid presumably!). Sewage is a passive, at scale, pooling scheme	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622257061036033	Finally we can think about pooling - 5 way or 10 way pooling which automatically increases capacity but then one needs to agonise about sensitivity follow up protocols.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:59	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622255949635585	We can go further. research evidence is that infectious people often shed into saliva; this can again simplify issues.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:58	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622254603214849	One positive is that many of these new testing schemes (including LamPORE from nanopore to be clear) offer far higher portability - in trucks. One can think more about bringing high capacity to a location and people management.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:58	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622253407895556	An important point about testing is even today the problem is not testing *capacity* it is testing *logistics/operations*. With the new technologies coming on-stream it is the logistics/operations side that needs as much effort as the technical capacity side.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:57	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622250903904256	How to do this? We need to test deeper, and do our upmost to test moderate to high risk individuals.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:57	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622249683357696	"So, we need to push to the next level of reducing transmission by isolation. As a backstop we have to still have on the table large ""lockdown"" like measures. These though are massively disruptive and we should aim to avoid them if at all possible."	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:57	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622248508960771	Secondly in the northern hemisphere it will be harder to easily be outside. We know high transmission risk is indoor places with poor ventilation; shouting and singing are not good.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:57	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622247309316099	The autumn involves changes in contact patterns. Firstly schools, in particular older students and universities would naturally come back and this implies far more contacts inside these groups.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:56	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622246143373313	Despite though this progress on treatments and vaccines - and we need to do this all as fast as can be done safely - we are looking at least navigating autumn, probably winter without a massive change to the profile of the disease on these two fronts.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:56	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622244620832769	Vaccines do not have to have perfect to be useful; reducing transmission by 50% would be great; reducing severity of disease by 50% would be great; anything higher or combinations of these - wow!	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:56	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622243425452033	Vaccine progress has also been remarkable; there are over 100 candidate vaccines; a far smaller number have got to Phase 3 trials (I am one such person on a Phase 2/3 trial!). Noone would have predicted this progress in march.	2020	08
2020-08-04 12:14:55	ewanbirney	183548902	1290622242251067392	Far further from my expertise are the smaller improvements in clinical care pathways (airflow improvements, anti-coagulants, proning etc). These too need to happen and be shared worldwide.	2020	08

I looked at @inpredict's 3pt windup on Snell which shows much higher release w/ defense. https://t.co/yrWXU9P7nO	2020	08
