Of course knowing the prevalence is important but that does not dictate sample size for a metabolomics study. You always have keep the base rate fallacy in mind when presenting results but that is an easy calculation if you know the prevalence.	2020	02

A biomarker ROC without the knowledge of a phenotype's prevalence in a target population is useless. If the prevalence is 1%, we will need 10000 samples to show a &lt;5% error rate, unless the population is further narrowed down.	2020	02

That is why we design retrospective nested studies drawn from prospective biobanks. Eg our pre-eclampsia work. Prevalence of 3-5% - had to prospectively collect samples from &gt; 3,000 before we could design a suitably powered metabolomics study.	2020	02

Or do we end up overdiagnosing small polyps that would have never caused an issue? These are questions we have to ask ourselves.	2020	02

But it can spread rapidly and has seeded small clusters in many places -- a pandemic is a possibility. Health care systems and supply chains need to prepare for this case as much as possible. [9/9]	2020	02
2020-02-17 19:27:13	richardneher	794631618	1229487483852926981	Since the parameters underlying these models are uncertain and the models are a caricature of real-world complexity, this work is meant as an exploration of possibilities to help interpret changes in prevalence, not as a definitive prediction.

2020-02-17 19:27:12	richardneher	794631618	1229487481004920835	Eventually, a pandemic virus could settle into an endemic virus similar to the current seasonal CoVs or influenza viruses. [7/9] https://t.co/XiAOXJ50ct	2020	02

Need a public test data set.The AMLs are nice, but very different from breast cancer metastases in mutation and CNA rate. Need diversity across cancers and experimental design.	2020	02
2020-02-17 05:08:58	CFlensburg	2156191704	1229271498499641344	"Also, we were lucky that a recent study used superFreq together with other pipelines in a paper on metastatic breast cancer: https://t.co/HeTtusLDik.This really is the best test, others using the software, and they found that ""Results were overall consistent between methods""."	2020	02

Some cases where results differ, I think due to the low mutation rate of AML and threshold effects for pipelines deciding if enough variants to call a clone."	2020	02
