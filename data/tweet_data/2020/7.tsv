2020-07-30 18:44:24	jonatanpallesen	4052598077	1288908320326275073	That is, it should be stated in a way such that it is hypothetically quantifiable what the disagreement is about, and where its not solely a difference in mood affiliation.	2020	07

2020-07-30 18:44:22	jonatanpallesen	4052598077	1288908311027494913	Or maybe she means that if we imagine a similar world, but without the history of slavery and without racism, the impact could be different. Now we are into some very hypothetical scenarios, with unclear implications.	2020	07
2020-07-30 18:44:22	jonatanpallesen	4052598077	1288908308015964160	Ok, maybe she thinks that the sum of the effect of the variants have some difference, but we don't know the direction.

2020-07-30 18:44:21	jonatanpallesen	4052598077	1288908305155395584	I assume this is not what she disagrees about. Maybe she thinks that it is the sum of the effect of the variants is exactly equal when added up. But as @SamHarrisOrg points out, this is astronomically unlikely.	2020	07
2020-07-30 18:44:20	jonatanpallesen	4052598077	1288908302563389446	But not only is it not pseudo-science - it is trivially true. Genetics plays a role in all outcomes in life, and racial groups differ in many ways genetically, so of course these genetic differences play some role.	2020	07

2020-07-25 17:44:21	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287081268547649538	Given the compute resources necessary to even start to address some of them, it is not clear who will be able to answer these questions, but I thought I would put them out there to see if others are thinking about it in the same way.	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:44:14	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287081236180226048	I find all these questions a very interesting line of research, necessary I think to help decide if GPT-3 is a step towards AGIs.	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:44:01	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287081181541011456	More generally, given a DL model, can we measure what parts of a training set contribute to learning a specific behavior?	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:43:52	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287081147357450241	For instance, did this ability emerge as part of predicting non-arithmetic text, in stories where it is necessary to keep track of number of persons or objects? Is there a way to figure out exactly what parts of the training set contributed to learning the algorithm?	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:43:41	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287081099043246081	This is intriguing, because it would point to perhaps learning general neural functions being encouraged when the functions can be reused to solve a variety of prediction context within the training set.	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:43:28	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287081043749740544	If such a model succeeded on this task, would a smaller model achieve similar performance?If a large model failed with this task, given an arithmetic training set, it would strongly suggest that other parts of the training set played a role in learning the arithmetic algorithm.	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:43:16	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287080993451581440	Is only text that contains simple arithmetic problems in the training set responsible for learning the algorithm?

2020-07-25 17:42:50	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287080884110327811	I think that answering this question would go a long way towards helping us understand how general neural functions can emerge during unsupervised training.	2020	07
2020-07-25 17:42:37	FabienCampagne	404562752	1287080829290713088	If the model is not memorizing answers to the test arithmetic question common to the training and test set and has only 2,000 example addition problems, how exactly did it learn an approximate algorithm to compute simple arithmetic?	2020	07

The thing I'm most curious about is what % of circulating CD4+/CD8+ recognize SARS-CoV-2. They should have done ICS! 10/	2020	07
2020-07-21 02:56:03	iskander	6899782	1285408167556456449	Disappointingly, there is very little T-cell response profiling. All we know is that is that ex-vivo IFNg ELISpot increased after first injection (boost did not further increase). Since peptides in pool were 15mers, I'm guessing these are mostly CD4+ responses.9/ https://t.co/Yp2HGQ4lWa	2020	07

There is a positive, post SARS-CoV-2 future possible for us all. Let's make that future real.	2020	07
2020-07-20 17:28:15	ewanbirney	183548902	1285265277270339589	Broadly, we (humans) can beat this virus; each month you can feel the progress we make; that progress is made in many different countries and in different disciplines.	2020	07
2020-07-20 17:28:15	ewanbirney	183548902	1285265275957514247	Finally from studies in France, Germany and Denmark it looks like young children do not transmit the virus. A saving aspect of this pandemic has been that children are spared, and the concerns is more about transmission than disease.	2020	07
2020-07-20 17:28:15	ewanbirney	183548902	1285265274732711938	"This virus transmits in a over-dispersed (clustered) manner, with high risk environments (the ""3 c's"" from Japan a catchy way to remember) responsible for much of the transmission. This makes trace+test *more* efficient by back-tracing to points of infection."	2020	07
2020-07-20 17:28:14	ewanbirney	183548902	1285265273461899265	Added to this is the potential of sewage testing - nature's natural pooling scheme - for situational awareness. This I feel can really augment broad individual testing. It's not perfect; it is likely to be useful.	2020	07

Possibly related: the phase 3 rVSV-ZEBOV trial had a few serious AEs. I wonder if that's why it's only used during outbreaks.5/5 https://t.co/BH7Nm77qR5"	2020	07

No, they show measured MHC affinities in other HA peptides and that computational MHC ligand predictions are a necessary but insufficient filter for immunodominant epitopes.

Naive repertoire recognizes epitopes scattered around the full length of HA, but memory T cells after vaccination exhibit different immunodominant hotspots.5/ https://t.co/I71MBek06A	2020	07

Rapidly transcribed transcripts could evict and release PRC2 from the local chromatin (so I guess something else comes in to start the expression ramp-up)2. PRC2 shows a preference for G4 RNA, which has been shown to evict PRC2 during gene activation	2020	07
2020-07-06 22:14:39	morris_genetics	26809559	1280263919655739392	Re: inactivation1. An RNA bridge serves as an intermediate step for PRC2 to scan chromatin context (that means if it's open or closed?)2. This brings PRC2 to the local chromatin3. PRC2 then engages with the chromatin and induces a H3K27me3 event, suppressing open chromatin	2020	07

2020-07-06 22:14:38	morris_genetics	26809559	1280263914970890243	All 1,918 differential genes had increased expression in MT cells and they found an enrichment for GO terms for cardiac tissues. They go on to differentiate MT iPSCs to cardiomyocytes and found MT cells don't beat as well as WT cells. So cool - I had no clue you could do this. https://t.co/pA8KznGdbD	2020	07
2020-07-06 22:14:37	morris_genetics	26809559	1280263911875502081	Long et al. then used CRISPR to engineer iPSCs with a mutant EZH2. MT cells should be defective in RNA binding, but nothing else (so the PRC2 complex is fine). Comparing this to WT, they saw reduction in H3K27me3 at target loci and can identify differentially regulated genes. https://t.co/wQa2RqliO4	2020	07
2020-07-06 22:14:36	morris_genetics	26809559	1280263909744705539	Their study design is to prepare iPSCs for ChIP-seq, but test for the dependence of RNA interactions by treating them with RNase A (rChIP-seq). Strikingly, you can see RNA is really important for PRC2 binding (EZH2 and SUZ12) but not for proteins known to directly bind DNA. https://t.co/dhwndAmcvT	2020	07
2020-07-06 22:14:36	morris_genetics	26809559	1280263908427739138	PRC2 is responsible for H3K27me3, silencing its target loci.

It does not tell the magnitude of spread on the absolute scale, eg., DL has Rt=1.6 &amp; # of new cases=192, while FL has Rt=1.3 &amp; # of new cases=9488. Check both.	2020	07

2020-07-02 14:58:47	hannes_brt	3052051	1278704679552155648	All of this is to say that there are excellent reasons to a doctorate in Germany, but the differences go much beyond pay levels and health insurance.	2020	07

However, when I did my PhD at @utoronto, I found the additional coursework I did very relevant and there was a more managed transition from student to independent researcher.	2020	07
2020-07-02 14:58:46	hannes_brt	3052051	1278704676985286658	The unstructured nature of the program (or the absence of any program) can also be either a pro or a con depending on your needs and expectations. If you are already well prepared to do research and are ready to jump in then you won't have to deal with course requirements,	2020	07
2020-07-02 14:58:46	hannes_brt	3052051	1278704676079316992	This happens all the time in other countries too, of course, but I feel that the layer of departmental supervision in structured PhD programs adds an important safeguard.	2020	07

2020-07-02 14:58:46	hannes_brt	3052051	1278704674271526912	This can mean a lot more flexibility if things are well between you and your supervisor are well, but the absence of a committee and departmental progress monitoring means that you're much more dependant on your supervisor.	2020	07
2020-07-02 14:58:45	hannes_brt	3052051	1278704672489050112	There exist only few graduate schools in Germany that offer a structured program including a curriculum, progress monitoring, and a supervisory committee.
