And Zhouwei found that the lost chromosome 18 could be either from the mother or the father, in these multifocal NETs. So an underlying germline mutation on chromosome 18 is unlikely	2020	04

We studied multifocal ileal NETs identified by our colleague, surgeon Dr. Eric Nakakura at UCSF.	2020	04

Loss of function mutations in the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1B are found in ~10% of cases. And chromosome 18 LOH is found in most cases.	2020	04

Thus, if an infection started with ~100 virions, they would be a mighty ~3,200 after 2.5 days. This is far from an 'infection', and a patient carrying ~3,200 viruses would hardly be infective, i.e. most aerosolised virions fail to transmit. (5/5)	2020	04

This falls at the lower end of the incubation period for #COVID19 and feels implausible for some other reasons (4/5).	2020	04

Though, they seem to  observe an excess in Flu-Like Symptoms (eFLSs) often peaking in 2019 already. I found no attempt in the paper to explain the earlier non-COVID19 eFLSs.

This is in itself problematic as unmonitored epidemics of all sorts of viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma causing mild flu-like symptoms happen all the time. (2/5)	2020	04

The 2 acutus that group together share a few novel mutations, but also have a few that 1 of the rhombifer's also has. With more sampling, I think the whole clade would get filled out.	2020	04

The general lack of foresight and decisiveness in the early stages of the outbreak, as well as the, at times, borderline obfuscation could be rightly criticised. (5/6)	2020	04
