2020-03-30 10:15:00	Jente_O	2207527682	1244568803482251264	More speculatively, we could use the information from ghost introgression to reconstruct certain characteristics of extinct lineages.This is nicely illustrated by a recent study that reconstructed the putative appearance of Denisovans.https://t.co/S1Kh4Y5F3H13/15	2020	03

2020-03-30 10:14:59	Jente_O	2207527682	1244568798767833089	Ghost introgression between two species might contribute to increased divergence and potentially reproductive isolation between those species and other related species, leading to rapid speciation.See for instance this paperhttps://t.co/UTNZWoMLnJ10/15	2020	03
2020-03-30 10:14:58	Jente_O	2207527682	1244568797127860224	During population expansion, individuals might interbreed with other species, rapidly acquiring locally adapted loci and outcompeting the local populations which consequently go extinct.

2020-03-30 10:14:56	Jente_O	2207527682	1244568788256927744	Given that fossilization is a rare phenomenon and that most fossils do not yield sufficient genetic material, we are probably missing numerous ghost introgression events.
