Some effect is clear but ref bias won't turn an apple into an orange. We should be careful with fine scale analyses though. 3/n https://t.co/I9BrmN4AtQ	2019	07

2019-07-30 10:57:22	generoom	281611141	1156156827614289921	Pragmatism should rule in the meantime. Yes  - run #WGS for selected diagnostics, but also do what works in practice, as comprehensively as possible. Don‚Äôt make anything worse. Collect evidence. Learn. Decide. #genomics #diagnostics (7/7)	2019	07
2019-07-30 10:57:10	generoom	281611141	1156156774359162880	#GLHs have an opportunity to compare national #WGS with more focussed approaches in practise.  The cost of the whole patient pathway should be included, not just the #diagnostic costs. (6/7)	2019	07
2019-07-30 10:56:42	generoom	281611141	1156156658021752833	But even at half these values, compared to a ¬£350/¬£400 gene panel that covers every clinically actionable SNV/Indel, #WGS in cancer has a lot to achieve to justify the cost. But that is where the Genomic Lab Hubs #GLH can help. (5/7)	2019	07
2019-07-30 10:56:16	generoom	281611141	1156156548101615616	On the other hand, national central testing is much cheaper than listed here. More like ¬£600 per 30X genome (colloquially).  Storage costs are on cloud, so a lot cheaper. Library prep costs are also overestimated.  (4/7)	2019	07
2019-07-30 10:56:03	generoom	281611141	1156156495282737152	In #cancer, 75X is NOT enough to call a negative. So add verification testing (not required on a validated panel). Also #cancer at relapse is not the same #cancer as it was at presentation. So at least double the cost for these cases.  (3/7)	2019	07
2019-07-30 10:55:41	generoom	281611141	1156156404241248256	#WGS that shortens the #raredisease diagnostic odyssey to one round, is cost effective ‚Äì even at &gt;¬£5K.  But whether the additional benefits of joint calling of structural variants and #CNVs justifies it in #cancer needs more hard evidence. (2/7)	2019	07

For reference, batteries could be 90% efficient and last a few decades. Grid hydrogen is like under 50% from memory. Pumped hydro is like 80ish. https://t.co/sABiHP62wm	2019	07

We will look at the real challenge. Let's for sake of it imagine making Aus's WHOLE current wind capacity generate 1.5 GW of dispatchable energy (1 small nuclear plant) https://t.co/K4dJz08AlW	2019	07
2019-07-25 13:14:48	mtrw85	978010775523643394	1154379471853707264	So, maybe storage is a better solution. Here's a great way to picture how storage works in a grid ... https://t.co/ydKFRaWjff	2019	07

Here the troughs are at 0.4 GW. To make, say, 10 GW means building 10/.4 = 25 times our current capacity. So ~2350 wind farms (!). Or four medium nuclear facilities. https://t.co/Y99zoCJt1p	2019	07

If we build more turbines, capacity moves approximately proportionally, so we essentially re-scale the Y-axis. Here's 1/2 capacity in red and 2x capacity in green to illustrate. https://t.co/mxYoQCIArR	2019	07

A good test is to see if it can follow the shape of the demanded amount. To contribute its current ~5% dispatchably, it'd look something like this blue wiggle. https://t.co/s5C73T2qkr"	2019	07

As you can see, it hovers around 2 GW of energy. For comparison, that's about what one biggish nuclear or coal power station makes. But coal sucks balls so we're talking nuclear today. https://t.co/5nHn12fyHR	2019	07

Just to get us in the mood, note that the mean wind has sort of died currently and the sun has set (red). So you'd need storage if you didn't have fossils (blue). https://t.co/4lsulBl37o	2019	07

2019-07-24 12:58:49	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013063869325317	14/ What @IEEEorg appears to be pulling off is harmful to scientific discourse. Forcing authors to hand over ownership of the copyright if they want to share their work as a preprint as it is being considered for publication at an IEEE publication, is completely unacceptable.	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:48	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013060669067269	13/ That FAQ only talks about ‚ÄúAccepted Versions of Papers‚Äù and gives the impression that copyright transfer to IEEE only takes places after an article has been accepted for publication. I am not sure if the other scenarios are an intentional omission, but this is confusing. https://t.co/CslQHZtB44	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:46	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013052762767360	12/ However, things get even more murky when consulting other guidelines put out by IEEE, such as their ‚ÄúFAQ on Intellectual Property Rights for IEEE Authors‚Äù (https://t.co/xy6p4yqHqp), which is linked from IEEE Intellectual Property Rights website: https://t.co/Joqnuzc0kS.	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:46	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013051311591424	11/ Note that the rules in the @IEEEorg PSPB Operations Manual are even more stringent, including cases where a preprint was posted *before* submission to an IEEE publication venue. The posting policy page only mentions situations in which the preprint is posted after submission.	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:45	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013048270667776	10/ The above policies seems to be backed by the ‚ÄúOperations Manual‚Äù (https://t.co/JAdhH25BWN) of the IEEE Publication Services &amp; Products Board, which are ‚ÄúComprehensive guidelines for every aspect of publishing with IEEE‚Äù.  See Section 8.1.9 D. E-prints: https://t.co/AyFK0Ihz7J https://t.co/8j0PebsbB1	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:43	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013038896459777	9/ And by the way, all of this not only applies to cases in which you posted on @arxiv or another preprint server, it also applies to manuscripts that you posted on your own personal website.	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:43	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013036279226370	8/ In case you are now thinking that I might have misinterpreted what this rule applies to, make sure to read the rest of that page.

2019-07-24 12:58:42	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013034534318085	7/ That means that if your article gets rejected and you want to resubmit it to a different venue, you will need to ask IEEE for permission first. Even if you just want to reuse a figure from your rejected paper in another publication, you will have to ask for permission.	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:42	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013032193896448	6/ Furthermore, the page states that authors need to include the a copyright notice, that prohibits any but personal use of the material in the preprint without permission from IEEE. https://t.co/gUcezlrIGp	2019	07
2019-07-24 12:58:40	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013023612407811	5/ That is quite curious, given that  authors generally don‚Äôt sign a license agreement until after their manuscript has been accepted.

2019-07-24 12:58:36	ngehlenborg	16557883	1154013008261238784	2/ This is long before your paper has been reviewed or you have any idea if your paper will be accepted.

2019-07-17 04:12:51	ewanbirney	183548902	1151343984192688128	The other aspect is that a ‚Äúcomplex tree‚Äù perspective does not magic away discrimination in society and when we do studies we need to ‚Äúremove as many confounders as possible‚Äù and take ‚Äúas homogeneous environment as possible‚Äù - our ‚Äúwell mixed subsets‚Äù also are useful for this	2019	07
2019-07-17 04:12:50	ewanbirney	183548902	1151343982259167232	That bias has been mainly the part of the tree geographically associated with Europe or recently migrated people whose ancestry (heavily) biased to connect to this part of this tree.

2019-07-17 04:12:49	ewanbirney	183548902	1151343976374558720	the current ‚Äúwell mixed‚Äù labels are less well mixed when one takes everyone - many confidently self identified Europeans have complex admixed ancestries - ie, the set-and-label model doesn‚Äôt even work that well even in the groups it sounds like it should	2019	07
2019-07-17 04:12:49	ewanbirney	183548902	1151343974696792064	This is bonkers; firstly there are *alot* of admixed people in this model, some with their own labels (‚ÄúAfrican Americans‚Äù, ‚ÄúHispanics‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhite South Africans‚Äù, ‚ÄúAfro Caribbean‚Äù); pushing a good fraction of our society into a ‚Äúhard to model‚Äù category is not going to work well	2019	07

Another might be that we have in fact seen such older lineages, but have misidentified them as Neanderthal or Denisovan. It's perhaps something we need to explore further.	2019	07

Shortly thereafter they encountered and mated with Neanderthals and multiple Denisovan groups, the genetic legacy of which we see in non-Africans today.	2019	07

Recent meta-analysis (N = 130k case/control) found 878 SNPs, 18 loci, but only explained 3.5% of variance in asthma risk. Future studies must get more creative to find genetic basis of asthma. #premed_ull #CampusAm√©rica	2019	07

2019-07-10 08:09:20	ewanbirney	183548902	1148866783094476800	This complex endless move, mix, move again (over centuries) is the hallmark of humans across our history and is why the business of trying to carve out sets of people as useful genetic groupings will simply not work well.	2019	07
2019-07-10 08:09:20	ewanbirney	183548902	1148866781311901696	It's probably the case that the movement of people today (certainly the individual movement) is more than in pre-history, but human gene flow happened alot (again in the timescale of 10 or so generations - plenty of time to do this)	2019	07
2019-07-10 08:09:19	ewanbirney	183548902	1148866779705462786	"This means groupings of people we feel socially quite confident on (""Europeans"", ""Zulu"",""Tamil"") are not some sort of indigenous ""out of Africa people moved to X and then stayed there until advent of sea born trade"" - this is not how human pre-history works out."	2019	07
2019-07-10 08:09:19	ewanbirney	183548902	1148866777755070465	These gene movements are just some; they are large many modern day Europeans have majority Yamana related haplotypes (but not all). We are likely to find many more both due to sequencing many more living people and ancient bones. It's an exciting time.	2019	07

We expect 25-50% hypotheticals. You'll need Illumina to polish all the nanopore indel errors causing frameshifts. Critical for bacterial pan genome work.	2019	07
