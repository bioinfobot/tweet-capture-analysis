However, more work (mainly via case-control studies) is still needed to determine if the additional genes are indeed PC predisposition genes #ProstateJC7/7	2019	02
2019-02-26 17:41:20	s_aldubayan	593999563	1100450758019989504	Finally, this study evaluated a very selected cohort of PC patients who were thought to have a higher likelihood of having an underlying inherited risk for PC (hence the genetic testing), thus it is difficult to generalize these findings to all PC patients.#ProstateJC6/7	2019	02

2019-02-23 21:29:36	macmanes	11824072	1099421039552016384	I should say now that 96.7% of the credit goes to my grad student @jen_spillane, who has spent literally hundreds of hours mentoring, coaching, and being a friend to this student. 7/8	2019	02

2019-02-21 09:27:13	ewanbirney	183548902	1098514467334340609	Secondly is that even the 1000G ‚Äúlabelled people‚Äù don‚Äôt all go to that spot and certainly not any self identified label (eg ‚Äúethnicity‚Äù)	2019	02

2019-02-19 20:27:54	dgmacarthur	16629477	1097955961107472384	Interested in using pext? The easiest way to get started is to check out your favorite gene in the fancy new update to the gnomAD browser, which now shows pext across all tissues (thanks to Nick Watts). https://t.co/HIuDeVZ4tP	2019	02
2019-02-19 20:27:54	dgmacarthur	16629477	1097955959261913088	It also improves gene discovery exercises in severe diseases like developmental delay and autism, by making it possible to remove a subset of LoF variants that are weakly expressed and have no disease signal, and flagging highly expressed regions with larger effects. https://t.co/k3rxuJrZ2m	2019	02
2019-02-19 20:27:53	dgmacarthur	16629477	1097955956908945409	The final metric was called (after some agonizing) the proportion of expressed transcripts or pext score. And it turns out to be broadly useful in separating important bits of genes from unimportant ones - e.g. throwing out lots of common LoFs but few ClinVar variants. https://t.co/xWiTFwPSIP	2019	02
2019-02-19 20:27:53	dgmacarthur	16629477	1097955954199425024	So @beryl_bbc devised a systematic approach to annotate variants based on the expression of the affected exon across GTEx tissues, accounting for various biases in short-read data. The basic strategy is summarized in this figure: https://t.co/8Cq64D55Ow	2019	02
2019-02-19 20:27:52	dgmacarthur	16629477	1097955952857247744	"Our team manually curated 401 of these variants, and found (as expected) a ton of errors. One of the major error types was what we called a ""transcript error"", meaning the variant fell on a transcript that looked like it wasn't real, or was very weakly expressed."	2019	02
2019-02-19 20:27:52	dgmacarthur	16629477	1097955951280238592	Our latest preprint, led by @beryl_bbc, starts with a mystery: why are there hundreds of people in gnomAD who shouldn't be there? These people carry predicted truncating variants in genes where these are known to cause severe dominant pediatric disease. https://t.co/lb6eTeWneT	2019	02
