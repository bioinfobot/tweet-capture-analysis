If the model is over-confident and assigns low-probability to a high-cost outcome of an action, then the expected value of that action will be grossly mis-estimated.

El fin. ‚ò∫Ô∏è	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:39	klsywd	283611777	1143250855509889024	"(23) In high school, I became interested in genetics learning about the human genome. It's crazy to think that 10+ years later, I would actually be earning my PhD in Genetics. I will be the first in all my extended family to earn the title ""Dr."" #firstgenphd"	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:38	klsywd	283611777	1143250854687805441	(22) More broadly, this paper really shows that characterizing protein structures can help in illuminating the dark matter of genomes - we definitely need more structures of pathogen effectors to fully characterize the repertoire of important pathogens.	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:38	klsywd	283611777	1143250853173665792	(21) In all, these results suggest that previous attempts at effector prediction in oomycetes may have missed out on many bona fide effectors, and that going forward new genome papers should incorporate the WY domain into their search strategy.	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:38	klsywd	283611777	1143250852557160448	(20) (for the long story - please read the paper ;)	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:38	klsywd	283611777	1143250851558936578	(19) With the help of many talented undergraduates, I cloned 21 of the WY effectors from lettuce downy mildew and did some functional characterization. Long story short, I found 3 that suppressed the lettuce immune system and I found 11 that were recognized by resistant lettuce.	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:37	klsywd	283611777	1143250849142988800	(18) Most of this work was done in the first 5 weeks in the @michelmorelab. The next task was to go into the lab and prove that these predicted effectors actually acted like effectors. This task took about 4 years (!!!)	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:37	klsywd	283611777	1143250847523938305	(17) I wanted to see if other downy mildews had WY proteins that didn't have an RXLR motif. I looked at downy mildews from grapevine, sunflower, tobacco, spinach, cucurbits, and Arabidopsis. And yes, they do have many WY proteins that don't have an RXLR (yellow+blue bars) https://t.co/ogYtv35hgp	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:36	klsywd	283611777	1143250844491501568	(16) Here is a tree of the 59 proteins I found in the latest version of the genome. Similar proteins are clustered together. Red=signal peptide, black=RXLR, yellow=EER, blue=WY domains. https://t.co/hlDRVypVOX	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:36	klsywd	283611777	1143250843166097408	(15) I used a model of this domain to see if I could find anything similar in the lettuce downy mildew genome. I found more than 50 proteins that seemed to share a similar sequence! And less than 20% of them had the RXLR motif.	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:35	klsywd	283611777	1143250840972480513	(14) When I started my rotation, a few protein structures had recently been solved for Phytophthora effectors and they all had a common fold, termed the WY domain. Here is what it looks like at the protein and amino acid level (structure from https://t.co/CsjAZkFjmK) https://t.co/hXK2yZi3jF	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:35	klsywd	283611777	1143250840087437312	(13) We tried looking for this signature in lettuce downy mildew, but didn't find very many proteins compared to other species. We began to suspect that downy mildew might be different from its cousins. So we tried to see if we could find other effector signatures.	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:35	klsywd	283611777	1143250838787203072	"(12) Downy mildews are related to Phytophthora species, which cause devastating plant diseases such as late blight of potato and sudden oak death. In Phytophthora, many effectors have a signature sequence called ""RXLR"" which you can use to fish out effectors from the genome."	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:34	klsywd	283611777	1143250837600272384	(11) When I started in the lab as a rotation student, we had a pretty good draft genome and we wanted to start finding interesting genes - primarily, the ones encoding for effectors. So I taught myself a little computer programming (Unix and Perl) and got to work!	2019	06
2019-06-24 20:13:34	klsywd	283611777	1143250836086128640	(10) The lettuce downy mildew genome paper can be found here! https://t.co/uoOH3DGQTl	2019	06

Nothing of this is specific to biology, that‚Äôs how academic careers work. The authors did the revised work themselves, right? This is no different to responding to concerns from review or meetings to improve work.	2019	06
