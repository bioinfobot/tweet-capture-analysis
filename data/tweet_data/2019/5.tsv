This suggests that thyroid receptors, in the absence of hormone, can act as selective repressors of pigment lineages.	2019	05

2019-05-30 21:26:02	coletrapnell	3177505453	1134209375503937536	So in hypothyroid fish, you end up with more immature cells of both types than you should. And the xanthophores don't turn yellow, so you can't pick them up under the microscope.	2019	05
2019-05-30 21:26:02	coletrapnell	3177505453	1134209374811856896	In melanophores, thyroid hormone allows them to exit the proliferative state and terminally mature. In xanthophores, thyroid hormone is required for them to acquire their yellow pigment.	2019	05
2019-05-30 21:26:02	coletrapnell	3177505453	1134209374136569856	Surprisingly, Lauren showed that neither model is correct. In fact, thyroid regulates maturation of both pigment cell types.	2019	05
2019-05-30 21:26:01	coletrapnell	3177505453	1134209372983140352	Backstory: hypothyroid fish don't make yellow pigment cells (xanthophores) and have too many black pigment cells (melanophores). We went in thinking that thyroid hormone either regulates the fraction that choose each pigment fate or amplifies xanthophores over melanophores.	2019	05

Or does a Tory leader lead the UK into ""no deal"" and the almost certain serious disruption of UK life  *plus* worse negotiation afterwards?"	2019	05
2019-05-26 11:57:21	ewanbirney	183548902	1132616711386144768	Finally although the Tory party would like to have a proper majority in Parliament (who wouldn't) they don't have the time or the confidence to call a general election.	2019	05

2019-05-26 11:57:20	ewanbirney	183548902	1132616706365493248	However, the maths to get a deal through Parliament is hard. The EU might do some window dressing to alter/sweeten the deal, but unlikely to do something substantial (in particular around the Irish border), and this was tried by May multiple times. Does a new leader change this?	2019	05
2019-05-26 11:57:20	ewanbirney	183548902	1132616704612282368	"This means the candidates are playing up a no-deal Brexit *and* might actually feel that they have to do this (a no-deal Brexit meaning really ""screw UK life and negotiate deal with EU from an even worse position"").

2019-05-26 11:57:19	ewanbirney	183548902	1132616701068173312	"However, the change is dispiriting. Nigel Farage, the unsuccessful but nevertheless influential leader of ... himself and a general right wing ""we want Brexit by any means"" is seriously influencing Tory positioning"	2019	05

Marine sediments are the most diverse samples I've ever worked with. Some are fine with 50M PE 150bp reads. Others are still short with 200M. Several factors can be associated and you will only know if you measure them (salinity, C or N sources, temp, depth, etc).	2019	05

If is shared with other species (pangenome) then you assign to a higher taxonomic level (genus or above). Higher depth = more chances to get reads with perfect matching.

As suggested by review, I estimated completeness of some assemblies with checkM, comparing completeness scores after each stage of our polishing pipeline (raconx2, medaka, pilonx2). All done automatically by our snakemake pipeline	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:59	samstudio8	40444555	1128593359394758656	Alexa and @mason_lab were kind enough to share data ahead of their publication (thanks!), allowing us to perform a robust comparison of our nanopore assemblies.

2019-05-15 09:29:59	samstudio8	40444555	1128593358186852353	Great, so we have contigs, but how can we convince you they aren‚Äôt garbage? Luckily for us, Alexa McIntyre from the @mason_lab had recently published some PacBio isolate sequencing and assemblies for eight of the ten organisms in the Zymo communities https://t.co/gYei4Fhev9.	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:58	samstudio8	40444555	1128593356022525952	Unsurprisingly, given the log-distribution of coverage, assembling the log community posed more difficulty. Notably, Listeria the highest abundance organism (~37000√ó coverage) was v.poorly assembled. Very high cov seems to be a problem for the version of wtdbg2 that we used... https://t.co/9sGTM7ys52	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:58	samstudio8	40444555	1128593353476661248	Even so, for the even community; genomes near the expected size could be reliably assembled for the 8 bacteria for a variety of parameter conditions. Yeasts proved much harder to assemble but this is expected given their lower coverage. Big contigs from metagenomes can be done! https://t.co/vXUExcgRZI	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:57	samstudio8	40444555	1128593349928157184	I made assemblies for log/even from Grid/Prom; varying HPC k-mer size (p), minimum edge weight (e) and read length threshold (L). However, with wtdbg2 under such active development, I gave up trying to find a parameter set that could optimise assembly size &amp; contiguity. https://t.co/B9WnkLoMOL	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:57	samstudio8	40444555	1128593348741292032	You‚Äôre probably wondering, did it assemble? I used wtdbg2 (https://t.co/rMrRJcdk2s) to construct metagenomic assemblies of both even &amp; log communities, for GridION and a randomly subsampled 25% PromethION. It was fast, reliable and worked well. But! Parameter choices need care.	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:56	samstudio8	40444555	1128593347457835009	We did notice a difference in sequencing speed between the PromethION (mean 419 bp/s and 437 bp/s for even and log) and the GridION (mean speed 352 bp/s and 372 bp/s) which we attributed to different running temperatures on the instrument (39C and 34C respectively).	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:56	samstudio8	40444555	1128593345301889024	This permits us to assemble some of the lower abundance organisms from the log-distributed community and detect organisms at extremely low abundance with more confidence. This is crucial for applications where important community members are not present in the highest abundance. https://t.co/gcpaYFdPg1	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:55	samstudio8	40444555	1128593342701420544	As @scalene split the sequencing libraries for the two communities between the GridION and PromethION we could directly compare the platforms. My review: it's like having a more powerful microscope. We get 10-fold more data from the PromethION at very similar quality to GridION. https://t.co/bIjHyzQY2d	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:55	samstudio8	40444555	1128593340277170176	This is particularly interesting to see in the log community where species are distributed on a log scale, from 89.1% down to 0.000089% relative abundance. We could detect the lowest abundance organism using 4 GridION reads, from just 50 cells of input. Highly sensitive! https://t.co/m8rDV5XJsg	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:54	samstudio8	40444555	1128593339081740289	Aligning our @nanopore metagenomic reads to the Illumina-derived isolate references, we observed all 10 microbial species in the community were sequenced in the expected proportion. Cool: long-read metagenomics can be representative of the underlying community.	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:54	samstudio8	40444555	1128593337550811137	Additionally, thanks to @ZymoResearch we publish Illumina sequencing runs for each of the 10 isolates, which we assembled individually into draft assemblies.

2019-05-15 09:29:53	samstudio8	40444555	1128593333725597697	As we begin to make big decisions with genomic data, it is vital that experiments are conducted correctly and that sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines can be validated. Yet, there is a lack of available testing data, particularly for metagenomics and especially long-reads.	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:53	samstudio8	40444555	1128593332110807040	Mock communities like these are really useful for both the lab and bioinformatics as positive controls. As the samples are validated to contain a known distribution of the taxa, they could be used to check that DNA extractions, or say, taxonomic classifiers have worked properly.	2019	05
2019-05-15 09:29:52	samstudio8	40444555	1128593329787211776	The goal of this work was to make available a really deep, long-read dataset for some community standards.

2019-05-02 02:40:54	CFlensburg	2156191704	1123779367832891393	@chrisamiller I'm biased of course, but I'd prefer an approach where you compare all callers on an equal footing rather than trying to define a truth based on the callers you want to assess. And across as diverse conditions as you can. Then look at what callers call what classes of variants.	2019	05
2019-05-02 02:37:46	CFlensburg	2156191704	1123778579853193216	@chrisamiller Yeah it's a great resources, and I'm tempted to play with it as well, although time may not allow me to. I'm just wary of defining the best variant caller as the caller that best reproduce the mutect PON filtering (or some consensus calls) for data from a single lab.	2019	05
