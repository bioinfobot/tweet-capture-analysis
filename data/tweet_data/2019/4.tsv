2019-04-26 05:43:55	jrossibarra	561297215	1121651097930612737	But what's this mean for real samples? Look at the bottom left panels of the figure. Depending on when you sampled, you could find ratios of œÄ/œÄ0 higher or lower than expectations, and ratios of Œæ/Œæ0 (density of singleton variants) that had similar or opposite patterns.	2019	04
2019-04-26 05:43:55	jrossibarra	561297215	1121651097087516672	In the botteneck example, what's happening is that sites undergoing linked selection are actually more affected by a bottleneck, as a larger % of variants  are at low frequency. Eventually the decreased efficacy of selection takes over,  and you get hit equilibrium expectations.	2019	04
2019-04-26 05:43:55	jrossibarra	561297215	1121651096357703681	But instead we see that this ratio DECREASES directly after a bottleneck. The same is true for expansion -- classic models predict œÄ/œÄ0 should decrease (because selection is more effective in a bigger pop) but it INCREASES instead. What the heck?	2019	04
2019-04-26 05:43:54	jrossibarra	561297215	1121651094629675009	For example, when Ne decreases because of a bottleneck, classical models (dotted line) predict that the ratio of œÄ (diversity at linked sites) / œÄ0 (diversity at sites unaffected by linked selection) should increase, as natural selection becomes less effective https://t.co/OHjmejBifd	2019	04

2019-04-23 21:13:06	CatharineKrebs	3884223149	1120797771194339329	Anyway, I'm new to bioethics and neuroethics (and yes, I'm disturbed at my own ignorance to these fields!). I just read this 2014 perspective from @rose_nikolas and found it to be particularly thought-provoking.https://t.co/Q4y8dmLSVK	2019	04
2019-04-23 21:13:06	CatharineKrebs	3884223149	1120797770506436608	We need to be incorporating ethical analyses into our research from the beginning, when we're formulating hypotheses &amp; designing experiments. Ethics should not be an afterthought, something we briefly consider as we revise &amp; submit the same old documents for IRB &amp; IACUC approval.	2019	04
2019-04-23 21:13:06	CatharineKrebs	3884223149	1120797769759739905	I can't really tell you what I learned from those trainings aside from very basic concepts like give authorship credit where it's due, don't sleep w/ your advisor, &amp; definitely don't make CRISPR babies. Ethics needs to be a much larger part of STEM training than it currently is.	2019	04
2019-04-23 21:13:06	CatharineKrebs	3884223149	1120797769025884160	Despite having been a biology researcher for 7+ years, my ethics training is almost nonexistent. My pre-doc training grant required 1 hour of ethics training, which we completed during lunch at our annual retreat. And my grad program required a one-time, 2 credit ethics course.	2019	04

Yet to be tested!  and if power is off for the next closest switch down the line then we are pretty much stuck.	2019	04

2019-04-23 06:25:08	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1120574305966882816	@ewanbirney I'm a little bothered by how 'prediction' is getting used in this context. The implication for many readers will be prediction in all populations, but the reality is PRS is a measure of correlation in the study cohort, albeit with some attempt to correct for non-genetic factors.	2019	04

2019-04-22 14:44:29	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337583270182912	For @kph3k op-Ed  I think casting genetics as a ‚Äúluck‚Äù is ...a  reasonable position. Society then has decide how much luck is ‚Äúevened out‚Äù by ... society, state, local or federal. This goes to long-standing discussions - equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:28	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337581059788800	This seems like good evidence that environmental changes are (at least somewhat) effective here. It feels to me that this rather obvious but nevertheless valid observation is ... worth trying to work what *is* different between these environments of obesity generation	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:28	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337579302424577	I am also somewhat surprised that people aren‚Äôt commenting more on the French or Danish or Swedish obesity trend (not UK as trends closer to US). FR/DK/SE genetics is very close to US/UK genetics but the obesity trend is flattening	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:27	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337577368793090	All that said and done, on @skathire genetics of obesity - I find this less surprising than responses seem to make it; we‚Äôve known this for a while, and the (soft) predictability of obesity feels less useful that CAD or Breast cancer where there is public health interventions now	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:27	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337575313641472	(A note; be aware that language has broader interpretations with this broader audience and far more questions about motivation and underlying positions get asked in policy and politics)	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:26	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337571513499654	It does however mean that in these science meets policy +  politics  crosses US/ UK / Canadian / Australian policy+politics with participanting scientists worldwide. It makes for a powerful mixture	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:26	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337569374453760	The next thing to realise is that policy and politics is national ; science is international. In English speaking countries we‚Äôre lucky that the international language of science is the same as our national language	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:25	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337567025643520	Furthermore it‚Äôs harder to take a neutral point of view (or know where that precisely is) - here a diversity of views is key (ideally with the science twitter mindset - polite, curious)	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:24	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337564790067200	We‚Äôre likely to get more of these over time so we should get used to this. Stepping back genetics (and science in general) is often very indifferent to broad politics, supporting or refuting things that come from left or right	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:24	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337562764234752	Both of these are examples of genetics moving away from fundamental biology into human behaviour, with a far closer relationship to policy and even politics. This broadens audiences and creates more potential for angst	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:23	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337560545501186	Both of them are dealing with some twitter criticism with aplomb and should be applauded for responding both curious questions and sometimes impolite critiques	2019	04
2019-04-22 14:44:22	ewanbirney	183548902	1120337556015591425	My twitter feed is alive with two genetics threads ; one @skathire on his labs genetic PRS score for obesity. The second is @kph3k‚Äôs opinion piece on genetics of educational attainment and presenting this as ‚Äúgenetic luck‚Äù.	2019	04

Its all based on what variants they try to associate as SNP based on  population reference compendium. Will also be different in both .

Both  companies have their own SNP database built on customer base. They do not use anything from HGP. Ref assembly is different. So results will vary. But they are DTC non diagnostic. 1/N	2019	04

2019-04-18 08:29:01	mrtnj	17774791	1118793543013810176	4. The simulations suggest that selecting on (recessive!) deleterious variants identified from genome sequencing may help improve fitness of livestock populations, and that genome editing to remove deleterious variants could improve them even more.	2019	04

2019-04-10 20:43:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1116079180112961536	So - genetics is not the definitive description of what is going on causally. Many other things - random chance, decisions, where and how you grow up  - have as strong if not stronger influence. Genetics - and GWAS - is just a really useful starting point for many human traits.	2019	04
2019-04-10 20:43:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1116079179399876608	"This is miscommunication - every trait is mixture of genetics and ""other things"" (lumped together as ""environment"" - not a great term); us finding *some* of the variance in the population is due to genetics absolutely does *not* mean *all* of it is. Indeed, quite the opposite"	2019	04
2019-04-10 20:43:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1116079178552619010	Finally I know the enthusiasm that someone us talk about genetics (*cough* myself included) can come over as overbearing - people can misread geneticists as thinking that *everything* is genetics because of the genome-wide nature of genetics.	2019	04

2019-04-10 20:43:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1116079176518381568	"It is also correlated because the human population exploded so rapidly out of Africa we are still dominated by the ""founder population"" of those humans some ~100,000 years ago - very much we are still ""one tribe"" of 7 billion odd people in terms of our genetics.

Once a repo is set up tracking and updating metadata as you go is hassle-free. Also great to have backups that you can import anywhere.	2019	04
