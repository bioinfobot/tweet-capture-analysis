2022-01-31 04:44:21	tomkXY	2842025330	1488010239748493312	This low-cost low-input technique has a lot of potential to improve genomics workflows. It is suitable for many applications including ChIP-Seq and degraded samples. We have applied for Japanese patent on this technique and are open to discuss licensing for commercial use.	2022	01
2022-01-31 04:44:21	tomkXY	2842025330	1488010238133665793	There are a few caveats. BrAD-Seq generally had poorer sequence quality in Read 2. We don‚Äôt recommend paired end sequencing with this technique but it is compatible with it if required (as it is for some sequencing facilities).	2022	01

2022-01-27 22:11:05	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824104728547332	Summing up:1. Don't let peer pressure trick you into thinking academia is the default best option for you.2. Think parallel, not serial, when considering career options.3. Gather information, contacts, and diverse mentors early.4. Good luck!	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:04	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824102874677248	Know that when you talk to fellow academics about exploring non-academic career options, they may struggle to understand why. You may feel like actively looking outside is a signal that you aren't good enough for academia.Fuck that noise. This is your life, not theirs.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:04	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824100966256640	I'm not going to pretend these decisions are easy - at every inflection point in my career I've agonised over making a call - but your odds of a good outcome are much higher, because you haven't arbitrarily constrained the field.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:03	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824099095597057	The value of this model is you get to consider every opportunity on its merits. You may find an industry option that is better on every dimension than all your academic offers. You may find an academic option where flexibility/optionality outweighs salary concerns.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:03	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824097258504193	If everything goes well, you will find yourself with multiple opportunities, inside and outside academia. Consider all of them on their merits, and make the choice the best suits you, and that maximises your future options.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:02	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824095467511808	This is so important because different types of opportunity require very different approaches. Don't be fooled into thinking an industry employer will value the same things your academic colleagues do. Prepare yourself and your CV accordingly.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:02	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824093525577730	In the lead-up to this, you should be talking to mentors from the full spectrum of these roles. Don't just talk to your supervisor about careers. Seek out and find mentors from other backgrounds, people who actually know what a non-academic career is like.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:01	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824090878967808	When you get towards the end of your PhD, your plan shouldn't be to apply for postdoc positions, then *if unsuccessful* start applying for industry roles. You want to be considering (and ideally applying for) jobs across the full range of careers that would suit you.	2022	01
2022-01-27 22:11:01	dgmacarthur	16629477	1486824087724847104	So here's my advice on a career mindset for young academics: forget the serial model, and go parallel.Figure out what you're good at, and what you enjoy.Determine the full range of careers consistent with these parameters, and investigate all of them. https://t.co/ySSVEdAc6W	2022	01

2022-01-24 16:44:49	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654834896384009	Anyway, definitely read this review - and some of the references therein - if you are interested.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:49	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654833239662599	I interpreted (perhaps misinterpreted) her optimism about the potential contribution of genetics to social and educational research in this context - it seemed to me to be what she was getting at.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:48	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654831637438484	MR has plenty of its own pitfalls and assumptions, but it has already provided useful insights into non-genetic factors affecting epidemiological traits, which are not obviously less complex than those discussed by Harden.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:48	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654829989081089	However that doesn't mean genetic data have no potential role to play. For example I was very surprised the book made no mention of Mendelian Randomization, an approach which uses genetic associations to explore how non-genetic factors causally affect each other	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:47	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654828059607046	I agree current PGS are not in themselves very useful for these questions, and the book overstates their interpretability. Indeed I expect there will rarely be much inherent merit in finding which bits of DNA are associated with certain social traits in certain settings.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:47	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654826365108224	One aspect in which I perhaps depart from Graham and Molly, and from some other critical reviewers, is on genetics' potential role in understanding social and cognitive traits, and Harden's presentation thereof.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:47	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654824838443018	The latter in particular was something I reluctantly excluded from my own short review, as I found it the weakest element of the book.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:46	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654823148134403	But I agree with the criticism about the elision of different GWAS settings, and how the book tries to have it both ways in its treatment of differences between and within ancestral groups.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:46	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654821390671884	I still think the book makes a very valuable contribution and starting point for wider discussion of these issues, not least because it's much better than several notable previous books in this space. A low bar perhaps.	2022	01
2022-01-24 16:44:45	aylwyn_scally	856471832	1485654819016691715	This is a great review by @Graham_Coop  and @molly_przew of The Genetic Lottery by @kph3k.

2022-01-17 18:12:17	pashadag	28535384	1483140131192287234	Sometimes the bias is extreme, sometimes not. For example, there are cases when the true Jaccard is 90%, but the expected value of the estimator is only 44%. Depending on your use-case, you may or may not find this bias tolerable. 4/5	2022	01

2022-01-14 13:41:27	CamLBerthelot	1361833632	1481984809283072007	This has been observed in other polyploids and interpreted as evidence for hybridization, with one parental genome ‚Äútaking over‚Äù the other one. But in fish, this does not line up... so clearly evolution after whole genome duplication is more complex than this.	2022	01
2022-01-14 13:40:53	CamLBerthelot	1361833632	1481984668937375747	Second, we show that duplicated chromosomes have evolved asymmetrically after the tetraploidization: one chromosome copy often retained more genes and/or had lower evolutionary rates.	2022	01
2022-01-14 13:40:39	CamLBerthelot	1361833632	1481984609667756039	It also suggests that the ancestral teleost was likely an autoploid, resulting from genome doubling within a species, as its duplicated chromosomes were so similar that they could pair during meiosis.	2022	01
2022-01-14 13:40:27	CamLBerthelot	1361833632	1481984557255729155	This means that on those chromosomes, genes don‚Äôt really have orthology and paralogy relationships between fish clades.	2022	01
2022-01-14 13:40:18	CamLBerthelot	1361833632	1481984519821533186	This has profound implications for comparative genomics in fish. In particular, several duplicated chromosomes were still exchanging alleles during meiosis at the time when major fish clades diverged.	2022	01

2022-01-12 10:43:23	chicaScientific	147786817	1481215222081802243	Finally, @AudParish tests in bees under nutrient stress grow better with B.apis and it turns out they do! If you give bees a diet reduced by 25% nutrition, they grow to be small, sad bees. But add B.apis, and now they are the same size as their full nutrition counterparts! (7/N)	2022	01
2022-01-12 10:43:22	chicaScientific	147786817	1481215220735528960	It turns out, if you look at the evolutionary history of this group, B.apis has acquired 3 different amino acid transporters in its trajectory - pretty neat! (6/N)	2022	01

2022-01-11 18:56:49	ewanbirney	183548902	1480977010939908097	In Omicron one has these plus prior infection plus vaccination x age. It is I think going to be a different experience in different places, even in the UK, let alone between countries.	2022	01
2022-01-11 18:56:48	ewanbirney	183548902	1480977009425715206	This means I think the Omicron wave is going to have quite hetreogenous trajectories in terms of both hospitalisations and deaths in different countries - unlike the first wave, Alpha etc where one mainly had age and contact (NPIs) driving differences.	2022	01
2022-01-11 18:56:48	ewanbirney	183548902	1480977007471120392	For vaccination, as I keep on banging on about, it is vaccination stratified by age which is the most important thing. The aggregate numbers ... have meaning... but it is really vaccination numbers &gt;60.	2022	01
2022-01-11 18:56:48	ewanbirney	183548902	1480977005738967047	London also has a lot of healthcare provision in a reasonably close geographic region - easy for ambulances to be diverted to share healthcare loads. So healthcare stress is easier to spread in London.	2022	01

2022-01-11 18:56:47	ewanbirney	183548902	1480977002152792069	Really we need immunity levels due to vaccination (pretty well tracked) and prior infection (likely important to prevent hospitalisation as well as reducing transmission).	2022	01
