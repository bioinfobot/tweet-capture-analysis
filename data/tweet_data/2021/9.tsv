2021-09-22 17:29:24	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729960004526088	23/I heard they brought a special team from Texas to tap through that mud and connect the gas lines, but I never saw the finished product.In the Fire Dept we rarely saw the conclusion to most stories.  There were too many fire calls (150 per year) and you just kept moving on...	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:24	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729957655740425	22/ It worked perfectly!  Within seconds the fire was out and the gas, which had been trapped under 3,000 feet of Earth, was trapped by a mere 10 feet.The rest was Atlas's problem.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:23	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729955650838532	21/ As he worked to bulldoze top soil, we got back on our hoses and wetted the pile.  The result was a huge mound of mud 10 feet high.  When we were satisfied the pile was big enough, he executed the final step: Bulldoze the pile overtop the fire.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:23	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729953532723200	20/ Finally, after catching my breadth and a bit of food, I had my only good idea of the night.  The was a smarter way to do this...I asked the bulldozer operator to push up a pile of dirt next to well fire.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:22	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729951565537285	19/ In the Iraq War, the military had to deal with hundreds of well fires (much bigger than ours).  Eventually they designed special tanks, equipment and explosives for the job.We didn't have any of those, so this would require some Redneck Engineering.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:22	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729949560705025	18/ Around 4:00am we all but gave up.Our fire chief drove back to the station and grabbed food + beers for everyone. For the next hour, we leaned against our trucks, eating, drinking, smoking and watching millions of dollars of gas burn.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:21	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729947773886470	17/ Any cigarette or running engine, we had plenty of both, would end it all.Fortunately, the water strategy was not working…	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:21	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729945928462338	16/ The moment we got the fire out, IF we got it out, the field would start filling with tens of thousands of cubic feet of explosive gas.There would be 30 seconds of silence as the air-to-gas ratio approached a critical point and then BOOM.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:20	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729943944536072	15/ Between the two fire companies and every neighbor in the area arriving to watch, we had attracted a crowd. 30-40 guys standing around, watching and SMOKING.Everybody smoked.  I was one of only 2 guys that didn't use tobacco.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:20	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729941797052421	14/ The four of us went a few more rounds vainly spraying water at the base.  But we knew it wouldn't work.Frankly, I didn't want it to work.  We had a bigger problem by then.	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:19	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729939901173765	13/ Once the rig was down, we doused it with water (to cool it), wrapped chains around it and used the bulldozer again to drag it off the site.With the obstruction removed, the column of fire now easily exceeded 60 feet.Back to Plan A: Apply water to fire...	2021	09
2021-09-22 17:29:19	NickYoder86	328697563	1440729937892155401	12/ Myself, Chubs and the 48 guys worked the water again while the dozer operator shoved and pulled on the rig.   When it tipped, the four of us (two on each side) had to avoid getting crushed by the falling tower.	2021	09

2021-09-22 08:43:10	RJABuggs	354472005	1440597530429906953	A new open access approach is needed that acknowledges the joint responsibility of the users of DSI to protect biodiversity and share the benefits of its use equitably, without impeding the potential of science to protect biodiversity and promote sustainable development.

2021-09-20 14:56:47	treyshelton	14125235	1439966778143252487	18/ We are at the dawn of DAOs &amp; these new types of orgs will call for new types of recruiting tactics at every level.If you're in NYC this week for @ MessariCrypto #Mainnet2021 &amp; want to discuss, let's meet up. @coopatropah ?	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:47	treyshelton	14125235	1439966777342103558	17/ Analysis: We saw a surprising level of interest in a completely novel type of organization. There has been a lot of press around DAOs and crypto increasing curiosity for the space, which presents a good opening for recruiting new people to the ecosystem.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:47	treyshelton	14125235	1439966776528355329	16/ Negotiating comp packages for execs could present problems for DAOs but also could be a source of opportunity in creating new types of employment agreements based on the quality of output versus time.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:47	treyshelton	14125235	1439966775593025541	15/ However, every exec hire has unique challenges in making a deal work. Some candidates care most about base pay while others are more motivated by equity (or tokens). Sometimes, a signing bonus might even be needed.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:47	treyshelton	14125235	1439966774636781571	14/ Comp negotiations: DXdao has strict comp bands, which can be common in many larger companies. Nissa was accepting of her comp package, which luckily made this part of the process easy.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:46	treyshelton	14125235	1439966773848289282	13/ A potential replacement would be a work project taking 2-5 hours, which is then reviewed by the hiring DAO.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:46	treyshelton	14125235	1439966772745195522	12/ Eliminating the trial period will help keep key target hires in the process &amp; preserve a candidate's privacy if they do not want their current employer to know they are looking.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:46	treyshelton	14125235	1439966771872681985	11/ Potential concern: A trial period for execs might be too big of a leap of faith for someone who is currently employed or coming from a trad co.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:46	treyshelton	14125235	1439966770857644036	10/ The proposal was a 1-month trial, which can be typical in hiring freelancers or devs, but isn't common w/ exec hires. Luckily, Nissa was consulting at the time &amp; familiar w/ the crypto ecosystem so she was comfortable taking these steps.	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:45	treyshelton	14125235	1439966769918140427	9/ As the last step, the finalist put together a Work Proposal to shared in the DAO forum. This enabled the collective to provide feedback &amp; visibility into the vision of what Nissa would bring to the table.Nissa’s Proposal on DAOtalkhttps://t.co/kALcgerNuT	2021	09
2021-09-20 14:56:45	treyshelton	14125235	1439966769138094085	8/ This gave each candidate a true sense of what it was like working at DXdao &amp; how each contributor interacted w/ the community. This is a distinct advantage DAOs have &amp; should be emphasized in the recruiting process.	2021	09

2021-09-12 11:58:40	ewanbirney	183548902	1437022848531509249	The second big thing is that the NHS is pretty lean; it is lean at macro-scale (money in, healthcare outcomes out); it is lean in how it leverages centralised buying power (eg, drugs); it is lean in how it handles demand (eg, for MRI scans).	2021	09

2021-09-12 05:52:38	stuffysour	17841678	1436930733386477571	Given this, it’s really interesting to me, and worrying, that the autism research community seems to be somewhat unchecked by the wider science community in the relevant areas of research. Something to do with how autism is perceived, I guess.	2021	09
2021-09-12 05:52:38	stuffysour	17841678	1436930731964604417	To me it seems like the “let’s do genetics” equivalent of self-citation in research. It’s usually said that “about 1-2% of the population” (which?) is autistic. Besides the possibility that this is an underestimate, that’s actually quite a large number of people.	2021	09

2021-09-12 05:52:37	stuffysour	17841678	1436930729225691140	…is that here we have one academic (SBC) who really appears to have had an outsized influence on an entire area of research, especially with respect to diagnostic criteria.

2021-09-12 05:52:36	stuffysour	17841678	1436930727120101382	This is a good summary of the key issues I think.

2021-09-10 22:57:17	NatHarooni	101163662	1436463819069562963	6/ So what was my takeaway? Aside from monitoring for BCVA, we must monitor how well EDIT-101 can improve quality of life for the enrolled trial patients. I believe that there’s certainly a chance of relevant anatomical retinal and vision restoration for this data readout.	2021	09
2021-09-10 22:57:16	NatHarooni	101163662	1436463816683003920	5/ This particularly stood out to me. Even though vision may be greatly diminished, vision is not a direct correlation to photoreceptor function. We have to take this into consideration for key endpoints too. BCVA is just one of several different vision exams. https://t.co/B3CZQJWYjs	2021	09
2021-09-10 22:57:15	NatHarooni	101163662	1436463811901407232	4/ Here we can see the in LCA the visual pathway (Eye to Brain) remains viable, providing more hope for vision restoration. https://t.co/UcfC0ulRQX	2021	09
2021-09-10 22:57:14	NatHarooni	101163662	1436463806591508505	3/ The literature shows that although photoreceptor function is greatly diminished during testing, it still presents with functional ability in presence of a greater stimulus. https://t.co/Z1WyRnimfX	2021	09

2021-09-08 01:44:13	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418667919941637	16/x To combat these problems we provide a checklist of minimum standards for enrichment analysis. https://t.co/b6waSdzOps	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:12	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418662265966597	15/x We also observed that most over-representation analyses performed enrichment of up and down genes combined into one list. Our own testing shows that this approach has much less power to discover differentially regulated gene sets as compared to analysing up/down separately https://t.co/YUna76vBrm	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:11	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418656331026437	14/x When an inappropriate background gene list is used, the results are vastly different! Likely these extra sets are false positives. https://t.co/CieNUV851O	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:10	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418652279406592	13/x We also did a bit of benchmarking to see what these problems might cause to a differential RNA-seq dataset.We show that when used properly, over-representation and GSEA like methods give similar results. 👍 https://t.co/FeyGrhk7oE	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:08	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418647313276932	12/x This is a massive wake-up call that serious methodological issues are widespread with enrichment analysis.	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:08	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418644956155904	11/x After sampling another 1395 analyses, we looked for trends between rigour/reporting and publication metrics. There wasn’t any association, showing this isn’t a problem only with lower ranked journals. https://t.co/ybbTapeTo7	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:06	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418638949896194	10/x There were 15 analyses that lacked even the most basic methodological detail, like which tool was used to calculate enrichment 🤔	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:05	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418633073688577	9/x Over-representation relies on an accurate background gene list, but we found this was correctly described in only 8/197 cases (4.1%)!! https://t.co/HZaxpIMQ0c	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:04	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418627931398149	8/x In terms of tools, over-representation analysis was the most popular. https://t.co/aiqTJarKzk	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:44:02	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418619647721476	7/x We show that these methodological problems are very common. For example out of 235 analyses in our sample, only 119 (53%) specified conducting p-value correction for multiple testing! https://t.co/O8aljIQk68	2021	09

2021-09-08 01:43:57	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418598718074883	4/x Over the past few years I’ve been asked to review several manuscripts where the enrichment analysis was poorly conducted and reported. Examples of this include lack of FDR control, incorrect background gene list specification and lack of essential methodological details.	2021	09
2021-09-08 01:43:56	mdziemann	2882739367	1435418596587409409	3/x Enrichment analysis is widely used for exploration and interpretation of omics data, but we have noticed sloppy work is becoming more common. Here we show how common these problems are and what the impact could be on the results.	2021	09

I’m so excited I could almost fly. So thank you Lady Luck! And thank you Nextdoor app, which I hated at first but now love b/c of the amazing art deals I’ve been getting.	2021	09
2021-09-07 17:14:28	draubreytauer	15913794	1435290384356229132	I own a kiln! I bought it and brought it home yesterday. I’m still so giddy! It says on the side that it shouldn’t go up past 1800 deg F, but porcelain is fired at much, much higher temps so I assume it can actually go a lot higher. I will have to contact the manufacturer.	2021	09
2021-09-07 17:14:27	draubreytauer	15913794	1435290380505858048	I wasn’t expecting to get a kiln for a year or more, b/c they are so expensive. I was hoping to get a big kiln so I could do taller sculptures in, but I can still do those at other places. Having my own kiln to do a lot of regular sized pieces is amazing &amp; I can’t believe it.	2021	09
2021-09-07 17:14:27	draubreytauer	15913794	1435290379339894793	Since it is such a good price (new kilns go for thousands of dollars, used ones still go usually for hundreds or thousands of 💰depending on original price) even if I have to do a little fixing up it will be an incredible bargain.	2021	09

2021-09-07 17:14:26	draubreytauer	15913794	1435290376773029893	Still, it is an amazingly good bargain, I will hopefully have a kiln I can do about 6-13 inch high glass &amp; ceramic sculptures in, fuse smaller glass pieces in (fits about a standard plate size around, inside 13 inch height, outside 18 inch height).	2021	09

Rather than intravitreal injection which is dosed to the center of the eye, subretinal injection allows for dosing directly to the level of photoreceptors. This is important to note because the retina is about 10 layers thick. https://t.co/0UaU0HTLt2	2021	09
2021-09-04 12:58:06	NatHarooni	101163662	1434138705095180291	3/ What is CEP290 responsible for? In short, CEP290 is a responsible for photoreceptor structure which directly correlates to its function. https://t.co/m1NYv59a5O	2021	09
2021-09-04 12:58:05	NatHarooni	101163662	1434138701035188230	2/ How does LCA10 cause vision loss? The retina contains a group of specialized light-sensing cells called photoreceptors (Rods &amp; Cones). They send signals to the brain to transmit into images. However, in LCA10 the photoreceptors Cones are damaged due to a CEP290 mutation. https://t.co/nWIR8waH1j	2021	09

There's no viable pregnancy on the scan but it's still not entirely impossible that the pregnancy could be viable. Extremely unlikely but not impossible. Is it a medical emergency?I had the D&amp;C. My hormone levels dropped. It wasn't ectopic.	2021	09

It was a form of abortion.For a variety of reasons I didn't want to do methotrexate. I asked for other options and we agreed I could have a couple more days and another scan.	2021	09
2021-09-03 06:07:04	genepedia	236998514	1433672876498952192	Whether this is a medical emergency depends a lot on who you ask. I was not going to bleed to death that hour or day but if the pregnancy continued it was very possible my health would be at serious risk. I was ~6 weeks. My doctor recommended a medication called methotrexate.	2021	09

2021-09-01 04:44:17	acarroll_ATG	3167801016	1432927267886223360	The accuracy increase means reads with fewer passes often have high accuracy, allowing acceptable yield of longer reads.
