2021-12-28 18:42:25	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899959480397830	(France though looks like it is catching up with UK and DK quickly, in particular in Paris / Ile-de-France, and if Omicron takes off in PACA I guess we will understand even better Omicron severity in unvaccinated individuals).	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:25	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899957307744261	Just as UK agonised in mid-december about how much one could extrapolate from South Africa on severity (somewhat it turns out, but it's complex), other European countries are going to agonise about how much they can extrapolate/understand from UK and DK, the early Omicron leaders	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:24	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899954770153478	It is tempting just to go slow - lockdown to get time to see perhaps mistakes or successes other countries make - and yet lockdowns themselves cause harm (we've not been collectively good at measuring them) and some things we desparately don't want to lockdown, notably schools.	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:24	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899952249417738	Faster, immune evading Omicron infection but with less inherent severity and new clinical approaches means we have multiple variables moving around at the same time; even more complexity for analysts and ultimately decision makers.	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:23	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899949309206530	But we also have new weapons - eg anti-viral drugs (note a UK scheme to have pre-positioned test-at-home for vulnerable people with express couriered anti-virals to home to try to stop hospitalisations) and in-home monitoring for low risk discharge (oxygen meters)	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:22	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899947119747074	Omicron's infectiousness over 2-vax, previous also means there is a new workforce issue of isolation - important to really be on top of for healthcare workers. This greatly complicates navigating Omicron.	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:22	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899944552869891	Here there is often I think too much focus on aggregate country numbers (78% vaccinated) and not enough on age-stratified vaccination numbers; more complex, harder to aggregate, sometimes not easily available (eg, Germany) and harder to explain, but the most important variable.	2021	12
2021-12-28 18:42:21	ewanbirney	183548902	1475899941948121091	Clearly the safest position is to have as many people vaccinated (3-doses, first dose the most important). It seems unlikely one can easily prevent exposure as Omicron moves through the population, so unexposed, vaccine hestitant people are the biggest risk.	2021	12

And the inflection point is brief--if you miss a week, it's already over!	2021	12

This provides a thorough view of the dynamics last week, but with omicron's faster speed, a more current view would be helpful.	2021	12

2021-12-18 19:44:25	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291683056427014	Vaccination, therefore, remains critical to protect those at highest risk of severe disease and death. The emergence and rapid spread of Omicron poses a threat to the world and a particular threat in Africa, where fewer than one in ten people is fully vaccinated	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:25	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291679902347273	Neutralizing antibodies are only one component of the immune protection from vaccines and prior infection, and the cellular immune response is predicted to be less affected by the mutations in Omicron.	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:24	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291676706283520	Close monitoring of the spread of Omicron in countries outside southern Africa will be necessary to better understand its transmissibility and the capacity of this variant to evade post-infection and vaccine-elicited immunity.	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:23	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291673476632580	Genotypic and phenotypic data suggest that Omicron has the capacity for substantial evasion of neutralizing antibody responses, and modelling suggests that immune evasion could be a major driver of the observed transmission dynamics	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:22	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291670024757250	Early identification has given other countries time to prepare their response. Omicron is now driving a fourth wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in southern Africa and is spreading rapidly in several other countries.	2021	12

Immediate notification of the WHO and early designation as a VOC has stimulated global scientific efforts.	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:21	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291663611633666	The notion of  immune evasion is supported by findings that show increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated with the emergence of Omicron in South Africa (See reference 48)  and  initial results from neutralization assays (see references 26,27) https://t.co/CjGBovw7L5	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:20	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291659245408256	We thus argue that the population level of protective immunity against Delta is very high, and that partial immune evasion is a major driver for the observed dynamics of Omicron in South Africa (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E). https://t.co/uIFUUJTfey	2021	12

2021-12-18 19:44:17	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291649241989125	The predicted combination of transmissibility and immune evasion for Omicron depends on the assumed level of current population immunity against infection by, and transmission of, the competing variant Delta, by prior infections with other strains, and/or vaccination	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:16	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291645416747008	The growth advantage of Omicron is likely to be mediated by (i) an increase relative to other variants of its intrinsic transmissibility, (ii) an increase relative  in its capacity to infect &amp; be transmitted from, previously infected &amp; vaccinated individuals; or both.	2021	12
2021-12-18 19:44:15	Tuliodna	424291167	1472291640865865743	We estimated that Omicron had a growth advantage of 0.24 (95% CI: 0.16-0.33) per day over Delta in Gauteng, South Africa. This corresponds to a 5.4-fold (95% CI: 3.1-10.1) weekly increase in cases compared to Delta. https://t.co/zW1WbhCdjJ	2021	12

Perhaps this could be optimized for smaller fragments in the future, but anything below 1kb I'm thinking is ineligible to put into a concatenated molecule.	2021	12

End motifs, especially those of long fragments, could be a potential avenue for biomarker discovery in the prenatal (#NIPT) setting. Beyond that, this paper is more of a launching pad for further inquiry/investigation (in my opinion).	2021	12

What was an unknown unknown is now a known unknown. 2. LRS instruments can divine the tissue-of-origin at a single molecule level using methylation.	2021	12

In fact, if the library consists of both short and long pieces of cfDNA, the prep may be easier on nanopore.	2021	12

In fact, most sequence reads were FAR below the optimal for PacBio sequencing (which is ~20kb). The molecules are way over-sequenced, which adds to cost, but only small returns on data quality.	2021	12

2021-12-14 06:38:00	PhilippBayer	121777206	1470644223296765953	We also find no association between yield and the overall number genes when accounting for breeding group/country of origin.Running a PAV-GWAS with NLR-genes alone reveals weaker effects and 4 linked genes, so it's an overall pattern - larger n in future shoulds work better	2021	12
2021-12-14 06:38:00	PhilippBayer	121777206	1470644221207986180	As hoped for, as NLR genes are always on like smoke detectors, so the organism has to spend resources it could spend on yield.It would not spend these resources on oil content, protein content, or the number of seeds, and as expected we find no association there!	2021	12

We encourage everyone to work in whatever environment makes them most productive. On-premise, hybrid, remote, or mix-and-match. 2/10	2021	12
