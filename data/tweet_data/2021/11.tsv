2021-11-29 12:28:53	vinodscaria	131401138	1465296705729957898	A number of variants (incl. Alpha and Omicron) have mutations in the spike gene which can adversely impact the efficiency of the primers widely used. This is called a spike-drop out on a Spike Gene Target Failure (SGTF). This is usually not an issue, since the 2nd primer works.	2021	11

I'm just intrigued that anyone believes it may still be now, and even more so, that some feel the emergence of yet another possibly more transmissible lineage supports those views.3/	2021	11

2021-11-26 16:42:41	modrak_m	2815528570	1464273412319236106	Now there are reasons to believe medical research is exceptionally bad in this regard, so maybe other areas don't need so much anti-fraud action, but I think institutional investment in detecting fraud will be necessary at some point - even if we manage to improve the culture.	2021	11
2021-11-26 16:42:40	modrak_m	2815528570	1464273410742226964	So I am uneasy about saying that detecting fraud is not important. Yes, improving culture and incentives will likely help, but I don't think fraud is going away anytime soon and science needs to figure out how to handle this better than firing whistleblowers. -&gt;	2021	11
2021-11-26 16:42:40	modrak_m	2815528570	1464273408548605969	You can apparently also run a whole prestigious research institute in a way that _NOT_ falsifying data will get you in trouble https://t.co/AFsaA20C3i  (while also performing life-threatening experiments on homeless people without ethical approval) https://t.co/sKSeVuhULd  -&gt;	2021	11

First is a deletion/substitution/insertion hotspot in the N terminal domain, that may be further remodelling the protein structure there.	2021	11

2021-11-25 20:59:43	jcbarret	20361904	1463975713019777032	In orange are three mutations that are probably meaningful biological changes for the virus, but not previously seen in VOCs. Two from VUI level lineages that likely had modest advantages over original virus, and E484A which is at a key site in the receptor binding domain.	2021	11

What we do know is that the selective landscape is very different from the one that birthed alpha, beta, gamma and delta.	2021	11
2021-11-17 13:44:57	ArisKatzourakis	805810843	1460967196188975106	A lot of this really depends on the mechanism by which VOCs arise, whether it is largely a population scale process or whether it does indeed involve evolution within persistently infected individuals, or some combination of the two.	2021	11
2021-11-17 13:44:57	ArisKatzourakis	805810843	1460967194595106821	But, it takes time to rebuild the global genetic diversity before the emergence of delta. This might mean that the time interval for the next variant of concern would take longer than the time it took to go from alpha to delta. It doesn't mean it necessarily will, or won't happen	2021	11
2021-11-17 13:44:56	ArisKatzourakis	805810843	1460967193051643911	However, delta sweeped through, temporarily homogenising genetic variation, a consequence of its own success in transmission. Of course, variation is a product of mutation and selection, and mutations don't stop, and variation has been building up since.	2021	11

2021-11-10 18:44:53	timodonnell	13135092	1458505959555338243	Regarding, (2) I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts. From my cursory reading it's not 100% clear to me that the authors actually looked for the TYIRPFETKV peptide, since the additional lysine in the C-term extension TYIRPFETKVK is what was labeled [4/]	2021	11
2021-11-10 18:44:52	timodonnell	13135092	1458505958003552259	For (1), DC immunization as a way of fine-mapping CD8+ T cell epitopes doesn't seem very convincing.

2021-11-10 18:44:52	timodonnell	13135092	1458505956518662145	So the simplest explanation is that TYIRPFETKV is the minimal epitope. Their evidence to the contrary is that (1) vaccination with TYIRPFETKV is not protective, and (2) TYIRPFETKV is not observed in targeted MS [2/]	2021	11

That's a good question, in particular as concerns the characteristic loss of smell (anosmia).5/	2021	11
2021-11-09 01:54:43	BallouxFrancois	1113747629282930688	1457889354454650882	Some may dislike this 'immuno-geneticky' stuff. Thus let's go basic. If SARSCoV2 often infected our brain, encephalitis should be a common complication. It isn't. A review explicitly biased towards studies reporting encephalitis, found it at ~0.5%.4/https://t.co/z9ZmqlhYYo	2021	11

A possible answer may be that the cell receptor gene called ACE2 that the virus needs to infect cells in our body is actually not highly expressed at all in our brain.3/https://t.co/RWS6G13n8S	2021	11

Evidence remains limited to date but this recent study in Cell suggests SARSCoV2 isn't present in the brain in COVID19 patients, in line with most recent, solid evidence.2/https://t.co/rBGQd5zvKE	2021	11

2021-11-06 01:12:38	frogsicles	37832467	1456791601020243970	To summarize: 1. Upreg. of metabolic enzymes likely allows A4  to consume more toxins than A32. A4 passively accumulate more toxins than A33. A4 flies accrue a nicotine-mediated survival advantage against parasitoid4. These patterns don't require active sequestration14/n	2021	11
2021-11-06 01:12:37	frogsicles	37832467	1456791599447379970	This assay showed that A3 flies (blue) consumed less media than A4 flies (purple), suggesting that A4 flies could survive carrying a heavier nicotine load than A3 flies. This might be what allowed A4 to accrue a survival benefit against wasps while A3 could not.13/n https://t.co/YPLh0P6wOG	2021	11
2021-11-06 01:12:37	frogsicles	37832467	1456791596259676161	We also noted that A4 accrued more nicotine than A3 in the 24hr period after they were first placed on nicotine media.We were surprised by this pattern because given the known metabolic efficiency of A4 we expected the opposite.

2021-11-05 21:29:39	devUdara	303858100	1456735488618991616	If such referral data was public; maybe you could derive something useful from it.But, you shouldn't build such a system based on one metric. We're some ways away from software being able to understand the nuances a human could; especially when it comes to judging other humans.	2021	11
2021-11-05 21:29:39	devUdara	303858100	1456735486496624652	In a similar vein, team referrals are usually a really good positive indicator of candidate performance in a hiring process. It's hard to find another metric that is so clean; especially within the tech space.	2021	11

2021-11-02 16:14:15	tuuliel	575655913	1455568949299580933	I'd be more likely to accept to review with this format, would enjoy it more, and would have more energy to engage in discussion of grants where I have an expert opinion. Score quality might improve. Practical challenges are solvable. Foundations, @NIH, would you give it a try?	2021	11
2021-11-02 16:14:14	tuuliel	575655913	1455568947714170884	Proposal: As a reviewer, in addition of your grants to read, you have another batch within your area where you participate in the discussion and score. The other ~70% of grants you skip, work on your emails, and tune back in when it's your turn. Every grant scored by ~10 experts.	2021	11
2021-11-02 16:14:14	tuuliel	575655913	1455568946128736263	We all know the reviewer type who think they're experts in everything...but our field is so broad now that in practice, you're unfamiliar with the topic of many grants, and ~auto-score within/middle of the range. This is a really frustrating process with little/no added value.	2021	11
2021-11-02 16:14:14	tuuliel	575655913	1455568944505532424	This idea of the entire panel scoring to balance potential reviewer biases is, IMO, of very limited value. We should be scoring grants, not reviewer arguments. It would be preferable if my vote _did not_ count when I haven't read the grant and have limited expertise in the topic.	2021	11
2021-11-02 16:14:13	tuuliel	575655913	1455568942810939392	Well, the panel format is from the days when people would travel to the meetings, and did not even have their own laptops. You were stuck in that meeting anyway. But now you could easily tune out &amp; do other stuff during discussion of grants where you have ~nothing to contribute.	2021	11
2021-11-02 16:14:13	tuuliel	575655913	1455568941003284487	The standard format: you sit in a grant review panel (now often in zoom) for dozens of grants, you've read a handful, another good handful is within your area of expertise, and yet you need to be present and engaged in the meeting to enter a score for each and every grant. Why?	2021	11
2021-11-02 16:14:12	tuuliel	575655913	1455568939065425934	The format of grant review panels and study sections derives from the time before zoom - and laptops! Much time is wasted on all panel members scoring grants that they know nothing about. It's time for an overhaul - for saved time &amp; enhanced reviewer engagement and recruitment.üßµ	2021	11
