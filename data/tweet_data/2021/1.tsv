2021-01-31 07:58:15	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787465534169088	Those broken starch gene alleles would be expected to be recessive. And because the plant is hexaploid, all six copies would have to be broken.My population probably has that recessive allele hidden behind the functional starch genes.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:15	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787464523313152	Still, none are sweet. What gives? Some of the varieties which contributed to my population were decorative floral varieties. They usually produce small, starchy tubers.Producing starch is the expected wild type. The genes to produce starch need broken to have a sweet tuber.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:15	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787463554457600	Tubers which survive storage until being planted this spring will be much more interesting as seed parents, since they'll have gone through a round of selection for my conditions.Those varieties will also be better suited to my conditions already. So... more produce next year.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:15	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787462556135425	Several of my plants did bloom, but I didn't collect any seeds. To collect seeds, I need to grow the vines on a trellis where I can easily access all parts of the plant. The seed pods are small and well hidden under the leaves when grown on the ground.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:14	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787461524402176	The seeds I received all germinated rapidly in soil kept moist. Sweet potato seeds are described as being very hard to germinate, requiring scarification to improve germination.I didn't do this. This suggests selection has already led to the seeds germinating more reliably.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:14	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787460706529280	I received mine from a collaborator who has had good success and decided to distribute seeds to others to move the wider project forward.	2021	01

Several breeders have described difficulty producing seeds up until they introduced some new genetics from outside their initial material. Then, seeds became more readily available.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:14	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787458881982466	Most sweet potatoes will only bloom rarely. When they do, seeds are unlikely because the species is largely self-infertile. You need multiple varieties growing and blooming together.Like with many crops, there is a community of independent plant breeders working with this one.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:13	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787457900515328	Every one so far wasn't at all sweet, instead starchy like conventional potatoes. Aside from that commonality, they were all over the place.Sweet potatoes are hexaploid, with 6 copies of each chromosome. This means any plant can hide a surprising amount of genetic diversity.	2021	01
2021-01-31 07:58:13	thebiologistisn	801492317085368320	1355787456822603777	At this point some are clearly beginning to dry out, while others seem to have held onto their moisture just fine and are as rigid as when harvested.A couple have started to sprout. It's a little early, but I'm not sure this is a fault yet.	2021	01

(I ate those too.)The rest went into the box to be mostly ignored. I've checked on then occasionally to see if any mold or other issues have arisen.	2021	01

The Rams have a solid defense, and just fixed the problem that has plagued them at QB for years. They could win the SB in one of 2022 or 2023	2021	01
2021-01-31 05:06:33	RobertMartinLT	1611561644	1355744256443486208	My hot take on the Geoff/Stafford trade is that the Rams benefit more. The value of their two first round picks is determined by how they do the next two years. If the Lions have now only added two late first round 2022 and 2023 draft picks, that doesn't seem like a great deal?	2021	01

2021-01-23 05:35:57	mgymrek	48306404	1352852552056901633	9/n On a related note, I am very proud of @anzheng25 for spearheading our lab‚Äôs first paper that is *not* about STRs üòÄ. (although, we‚Äôve been thinking about how to apply these methods to them as well. Ideas welcome!)	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:57	mgymrek	48306404	1352852551251632129	8/n Thinking about applying #deeplearning to interpret #GWAS and other variants: depending on how you train the model, you can end up with very different variant-level scores. I think there‚Äôs more work to do to figure out the best way to apply these for variant interpretation.	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:57	mgymrek	48306404	1352852550349807616	7/n On the other hand, conditioning all training data to be within open chromatin regions results in learning very different features, probably more directly related to the TF such as co-binding partners. This also really reduced our prediction accuracy as expected.	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:57	mgymrek	48306404	1352852549074739202	6/n But, how you choose training datasets for these models **really matters**. E.g. when randomly choosing ‚Äúnegative‚Äù (unbound) sequences, we mostly learn ‚Äúpioneer factor‚Äù motifs also predictive of open chromatin, probably only indirectly related to the target TF.	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:56	mgymrek	48306404	1352852547623546880	5/n Answer: depends. In silico mutagenesis typically does best but is really slow.  DeepLIFT was better at finding important regions, while Grad-CAM seemed to have better base-pair resolution to score important bases.	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:56	mgymrek	48306404	1352852546436567040	4/n We also did a bunch of simulations to compare model interpretation methods to find out *why* we predict some sequences to be bound and others not. We looked at Grad-CAM, #DeepLIFT, saliency maps, and in silico saturation mutagenesis. Which is best?	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:56	mgymrek	48306404	1352852545484464129	3/n Pretty well! For most TFs we tried, we could predict whether its motif was bound based on ChIP-seq very well (mean auROC ~0.94) just from local sequence context	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:56	mgymrek	48306404	1352852544670732288	2/n The main idea: TFs typically bind short motifs of 6-12bp. But only a small fraction of motifs in the genome are actually bound. How well can the question of ‚Äúto bind or not to bind‚Äù be predicted by sequence context (1kb) around the motif using #DeepSea style CNNs?	2021	01
2021-01-23 05:35:55	mgymrek	48306404	1352852543450214400	1/n Super proud of work published this week by @anzheng25 et al. in @NatMachIntell using #deeplearning to identify sequence context features predictive of transcription factor binding. https://t.co/2JZ808UACL Some key points:	2021	01

2021-01-18 10:44:32	pashadag	28535384	1351118267969138689	At the end of the day, we derived CIs and hypothesis tests from/for Nmut, n. islands, n. oceans, Jaccard, minhash Jaccard, and the CBER score from Jabba. The paper contains extensive validations and practical applications. Software available as well: https://t.co/tcmL5mQkqr 8/8	2021	01
2021-01-18 10:44:32	pashadag	28535384	1351118266891202567	This m-dependence technique can be applied to all kinds of other stuff too. For example, consider islands and oceans, which are maximal stretches of mutated k-mers and non-mutated k-mers, respectively (as in Lander-Waterman statistics). We could compute CIs for these as well. 7/8	2021	01
2021-01-18 10:44:31	pashadag	28535384	1351118265964253186	However, we soon discovered that this type of dependence had a structure that was already studied, called m-dependence. We could then apply what is known about m-dependent r.v.s to get our CIs! 6/8	2021	01
2021-01-18 10:44:31	pashadag	28535384	1351118264999550976	If these r.v.s were independent, then Nmut would be a Binomial, and we could compute a confidence interval using standard techniques based on the normal approximation. But unfortunately, overlapping k-mers are not independent, and we were stuck for awhile. 5/8	2021	01
2021-01-18 10:44:31	pashadag	28535384	1351118264202620932	The number of mutated kmers (Nmut) is the sum of indicator random variables at every position of the string, with each r.v. indicating whether or not the k-mer starting at the corresponding position was mutated. 4/8	2021	01
2021-01-18 10:44:31	pashadag	28535384	1351118263271497728	We noticed that the underlying statistical model used to derive the Mash point estimate was a common one, used in tools such as minimap2, Jabba, and Lorma. The model is simple: introduce point mutations at a certain rate, and count the n. of kmers that have been mutated. 3/8	2021	01
2021-01-18 10:44:30	pashadag	28535384	1351118262290046976	In our paper, we derive a confidence interval for the ANI from the mash distance, or, equivalently, from the minhash Jaccard similarity. Our results are more general, however. 2/8	2021	01

2021-01-18 03:58:12	richmeisel	26277608	1351016011068268544	...so maybe, in addition to the whole clinal genotypes thing, there might be some weird sexual selection going on where III^M males get access to both kinds of females (based on temp pref), but Y^M males only see the cold-preferring FC females.... https://t.co/7Z1eLPNtRD	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:10	richmeisel	26277608	1351016004328050689	And the male thermal tolerance &amp; preference is consistent with the clinal distribution of the genotypes. And the two types of females overlap each male genotype in temp preference. But the cold preferring (FC) females also overlap the warm preferring III^M males.... https://t.co/jzN1T0E3FW	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:09	richmeisel	26277608	1351016000603512834	So, summing up, we've got this YM-IIIM cline. The YM flies are more cold-tolerant and prefer cooler temps. III^M males are more heat tolerant and prefer warmer temps. We think this is the first time anyone has ID'd a single chromosome that confers thermal tolerance &amp; preference https://t.co/7M8gAVE5iU	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:08	richmeisel	26277608	1351015993984880647	The FW females prefer warmer temps, and they're much more specific in their temp preference. Males are also pretty specific in their temp preference	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:08	richmeisel	26277608	1351015992852434953	We've got the cold preferring females (FC) and warm preferring females (FW). And, it turns out, they also differ in how much variation they have AT THE INDIVIDUAL FLY LEVEL in their preference. The FC females are all over the place, but generally in the cooler temp range https://t.co/SFGj2IJBQi	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:07	richmeisel	26277608	1351015990189023233	So, here's where you ask, What about females? Turns out, some females that develop at 22C prefer warm temps, some prefer cool temps. And we have no freaking clue why! It's not related to anything we can identify in our experiments. https://t.co/nkOOT8IqoC	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:06	richmeisel	26277608	1351015987592753153	Pablo found those acclimation effects on temp preference. But he also found that Y^M males that develop at 22C prefer cooler temps that III^M males that develop at 22C (and only 22C), just like you'd expect based on the north-south distribution of the genotypes https://t.co/BAaLZ0OMNK	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:06	richmeisel	26277608	1351015984728047618	And flies that develop in cold temperatures prefer warmer temperatures. This is like coming in from a cold, snowy day and snuggling up by the fire. https://t.co/RXuYmu30is	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:03	richmeisel	26277608	1351015972208046083	Pablo raised flies at 18C, 22C, and 29C because, it turns out, flies also prefer temperatures based on the temperature they grow up experiencing. If they grow up in warm temps, they prefer cold temps. I think of this as coming in to the A/C after being in the heat for a while https://t.co/yFLo9bwPbn	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:58:01	richmeisel	26277608	1351015964159193089	So, that's all well and good, but flies are able to, ya know, fly away from temperatures that they don't like. Do they do that? Do the III^M males move toward warmer temps, and Y^M males move toward colder temps? Pablo set out to answer that question... https://t.co/OFpuAOWiJW	2021	01
2021-01-18 03:57:59	richmeisel	26277608	1351015957217619968	And what do you know!? III^M males (the southerners) survive longer in the heat block BUT ONLY IF THEY DEVELOP AT WARMER TEMPS! So, acclimation makes them more heat tolerant, and III^M benefits more from acclimation https://t.co/iGMJeitXHM	2021	01

Cheesy but nevertheless true.	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:37	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920808035516420	Ultimately 2, 3 and 4 are about slowing the growth of B117 - ie, tactics for a strategic aim. The strategic aim is 1 - vaccination. Nothing - nothing - should slow down safe progressive vaccination in any setting.	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:36	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920806743674880	"4. As B117 grows one will have to move to more blanket lockdown measures. Across the pandemic the mistake is often to have to see solid evidence of growth; I would urge not making this mistake and ""go early, go hard"""	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:36	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920805430849536	3. If B117 levels are low one should use S-gene target failure tests to prioritise TTI levels around S-gene target failures (the false positives for it not being B117 is probably fine to tolerate)	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:36	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920803748884480	2. One should gather S-gene target failure tests over the 69-70 deletion, and sequence a subset of these (randomly drawn ideally) to be able to plot growth of B117 in a country. Ideally one randomly sequences a subsets of positives regardless of test (as UK+DK have been doing).	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920802104791041	1. (cont). It is clear from the vaccination rates in Israel, Bahrain, UK, US and Denmark that one can vaccinate at a reasonable rate in countries - Israel being a stand out performer - but all these countries doing reasonably well.	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920800712269824	1. No stone should be left unturned on improving vaccination rates. Vaccination in a risk stratification manner will reduce - potentially quite radically - the health care capacity issues.	2021	01

2021-01-12 09:12:34	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920796849328129	The lack of aggregate growth now in cases in a particular country or region either means (a) you haven't got B117 yet (be happy) or (b) it is present but growing from low levels (as it did in the UK in September/October). (b) is both realistic and the very high risk situation.	2021	01

It's final growth rate in different settings will be somewhat different, but across UK, DK+IE, doubling every week is a crude estimate in 2020 settings	2021	01
2021-01-12 09:12:33	ewanbirney	183548902	1348920792189431810	There are pretty firm signs of growth of B117 in the USA from @alexbolze - this is interesting in that S-gene target failure is not a good enough proxy (yet) for B117 growth - Mass. has appreciable S-gene target failure but it is not the B117 variant.
