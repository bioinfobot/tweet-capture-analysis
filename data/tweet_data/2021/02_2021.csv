2021-02-10 05:43:27,JimmyBernot,546127613,1359377420596502530,This helps explain why species of Calliobothrium have such a tiny pea-head scolex even though their body is 10x longer than species of Symcallio. The body of the lengthy Calliobothrium tapeworms does a lot of the attachment work,2021,02
2021-02-10 05:43:27,JimmyBernot,546127613,1359377419388485633,The big surprise was: A NOVEL METHOD OF TAPEWORM ATTACHMENT! The much longer species of Calliobothrium use the serrations on their bodies (laciniations) to lock into dimples on the surfaces of shark villi. This is weird since tapeworms typically attach only with their scolex üòÆ https://t.co/Az1lfqT5KD,2021,02

2021-02-10 05:43:25,JimmyBernot,546127613,1359377413118046208,Its noteworthy that these genera are very closely related yet morphologically very different. Species of Symcallio are smaller with a larger scolex (attachment organ) while species of Calliobothrium are 10x longer w/ a small scolex &amp; a body serrated with flaps called laciniations https://t.co/F1hXh3E7Zt,2021,02
2021-02-10 05:43:25,JimmyBernot,546127613,1359377410727239682,The main difference is that species of Symcallio attach at the start of the shark intestine (right after the stomach) while species of the related genus Calliobothrium attach in the middle of the intestine.
