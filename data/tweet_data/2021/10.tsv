2021-10-28 21:13:59	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832439646801920	In summary, imo this is an over-interpretation of insufficient &amp; inappropriate data for the problem. There are many possible explanations for the authors' observation and I doubt that it would generalize to other datasets &amp; strain res approaches.11/	2021	10
2021-10-28 21:13:58	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832437797167112	More importantly, the ASV data used by Rashidi et al generally does not even resolve strains (see above), but at best (sub-)species. So it is less appropriate here than what prior studies on the topic already provided.10/	2021	10
2021-10-28 21:13:57	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832434491998211	Rashidi et al quite explicitly call out our study, but they misconstrue our approach. We explicitly profiled strain *populations*, not just single dominant strains. Indeed, the oral-gut overlap signal only emerges at that pop level.9/ https://t.co/j65Ua56GiN	2021	10
2021-10-28 21:13:56	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832428540342276	So I don't think that the used dataset is appropriate to address the authors' question. In fact, the paper is a step back behind previous work (by us &amp; others) that used strain-resolved metaG, not 16S, and multi-cohort designs.8/	2021	10
2021-10-28 21:13:56	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832426648743946	3. Single cohort design.There are by now many studies with paired SA-ST seq available, both 16S &amp; metaG. In 2019, we already used 310 subjects in 5 cohorts. Why use only one cohort here? Diff extraction in SA &amp; ST, amp biases, etc.7/	2021	10
2021-10-28 21:13:55	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832424232738816	2. Low pyroseq depths.The dataset used here has low seq depth, arguably too shallow to resolve low abundant taxa. Moreover, DADA2 to call ASVs can work on pyroseq, but is optimised towards Illumina data.6/	2021	10
2021-10-28 21:13:55	TSBSchm	2801768621	1453832422240530434	My main criticisms.1. ASVs ‚â† strains.ASVs are the highest resolution achievable w/ 16S, but almost always insufficient to resolve strains. For that, one needs high-resolution metaG (i.e., SNV calls or similar) or ofc isolate sequencing.5/	2021	10

Each variety was grown from a tiny seed about a millimeter across. In their second year, the plants will be starting out with much more energy reserves and are expected to produce more and larger spuds.	2021	10

Maybe.	2021	10

I'll keep both for now, as I want to have more diversity in my black spud patch, but I really like those smooth spuds.	2021	10

This also begs the question if Vax mRNA is being packaged, exhaled then inhaled in these exosomes.	2021	10
2021-10-19 17:28:41	Kevin_McKernan	33177553	1450514250569424898	Given the high dose of the injections (40 Trillion degradation resistant mRNAs), it is quite possible the vaccinated express more spike coated exosomes than naturally infected people.

2021-10-19 17:28:40	Kevin_McKernan	33177553	1450514249285988352	What is important to see here is that very low levels of SEB can create COVID pathologies: Dry Cough, Shortness of breath, Fluid in the lungs.

2021-10-19 14:59:32	emmabell42	22042578	1450476715894054913	Precise, accurate, and inclusive language invites other marginalised genders to the table, where we can work in solidarity with women to improve our lot together. Women (cis and trans), non-binary and trans men have an awful lot more in common than divides us.	2021	10
2021-10-19 14:59:31	emmabell42	22042578	1450476714501476372	While sex obviously correlates with gender, female =/= woman and male =/= men. It does not erase women to acknowledge that with precise, accurate, and inclusive language (e.g. pregnant people as opposed to pregnant women).	2021	10
2021-10-19 14:59:31	emmabell42	22042578	1450476712265977875	Gender is a social construct comprising roles, behaviour, and identity. Gender is a spectrum. Most people strongly identify as either woman or man, but people also exist in the middle (non-binary) or do not identify with any gender at all (agender). https://t.co/p2m7ybhHAE	2021	10

Sex differences include sex hormone ratio, sex chromosome complement, and primary (genitals) and secondary (physical appearance) sex characteristics.

2021-10-19 10:28:27	jcbarret	20361904	1450408496449703936	What is perhaps more worrying is that it suggests the virus still has evolutionary paths to higher transmissibility open to it, and there are millions of Delta cases around the world without much sequencing coverage.	2021	10
2021-10-19 10:28:27	jcbarret	20361904	1450408495107481604	10-15% increase in growth rate would be annoying but not catastrophic for the coming months. Likely the reason we're seeing this in the UK is a combination of high case rates (more mutations happening) and high sequencing rates (see changing patterns quickly).	2021	10
2021-10-19 10:28:26	jcbarret	20361904	1450408493740089347	That is, landing 20 Delta infections in a place with only Alpha almost guarantees that it will go on to complete replacement, whereas 20 AY.4.2 landing in an existing Delta epidemic may well fizzle.	2021	10
2021-10-19 10:28:26	jcbarret	20361904	1450408491970084867	AY.4.2 hasn't yet spread much outside the UK, so could be a fluke (no biological advantage), but given that it's apparent advantage is modest, it needs to really get established somewhere to overcome stochasticity of small numbers.	2021	10
2021-10-19 10:28:25	jcbarret	20361904	1450408490023915520	And it has grown all over the place between mid-July (L) and now (R). AY.4 did a similar thing, but it was not displacing other Delta, and given that it hasn't spread through the world, likely just had some epidemiological luck. https://t.co/fyoyElx8ZV	2021	10
2021-10-19 10:28:24	jcbarret	20361904	1450408485829718039	Proportion of AY.4.2 (now on https://t.co/TBLIgGWt6U) has been steadily increasing in England, which is a pattern that is quite different from other AY lineages. Several of them rose when there was still Alpha to displace, but none has had a consistent advantage vs other Delta. https://t.co/mD5gQzKxgV	2021	10

2021-10-19 02:44:01	BeEngelhardt	1158733934	1450291617500258304	The MGGP was motivated by our probabilistic contrastive PCA model, where we perform dimension reduction for case-control data, and our MOE-hierarchical Gaussian process, where we additively combine GPs across structured populations in a hierarchical model.https://t.co/JOZaeLm9jT	2021	10
