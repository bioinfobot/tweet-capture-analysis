Within this time frame, progress bars are helpful for entertainment while a program does it's thing. There's not quite enough time to distract my mind with something else, due to the context shift cost	2021	03

Don't mix them up.	2021	03
2021-03-28 21:11:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1376280834865569793	It doesn't mean genetics wont contribute - it might; it is non-random after all - but really you've got to go a long long way from a Mann Whitney test of self reported ethnicity to show a genetic effect.	2021	03
2021-03-28 21:11:35	ewanbirney	183548902	1376280833162670085	So - what is going on when we see correlation? Well... your first thought should be the big hairy mess which is human society with all its complexity.

2021-03-28 21:11:33	ewanbirney	183548902	1376280826690813953	Furthermore, ethnicity is *really* keyed into visible differences, above all skin pigmentation, and this is just one trait. Honestly. It's not some magic thing. You might as well lump people by height or hair colour.	2021	03

2021-03-13 14:28:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1370743477311537153	However, there is a big, big difference to Spring or Autumn 2020; EU countries know the vaccine bridge is being built, and having watched Israel and the UK walk over their bridges they will probably be able to structure the mid to end of their bridges better still.	2021	03
2021-03-13 14:28:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1370743475721883649	I can't see a solution that doesn't require substantial tightening of NPIs - tighter lockdown rules. The precise mixture is for each system to work out (it is bamboozling complex to navigate) but basically - minimise indoor contact time is the major thing to achieve.	2021	03
2021-03-13 14:28:06	ewanbirney	183548902	1370743473964466181	Nevertheless with a higher inherent transmission (probably due to longer infectious period) and a somewhat higher disease causing (frustratingly) of this variant means the task of keeping transmission down is substantially harder than the summer of 2020.	2021	03

2021-03-13 14:28:05	ewanbirney	183548902	1370743471036887041	The UK has a staged relaxation process happening this spring/early summer - it seems likely this will work given the Israeli experience in front of the UK (though - we can still mess this up!). Frustratingly the EU has another set of months though to navigate the pandemic.	2021	03
2021-03-13 14:28:04	ewanbirney	183548902	1370743469157847040	This is pretty much as good as one can ask for - in the UK showing both Pfzier and Ox/Az vaccines work well, and furthermore both the UK and Israel have high levels of the B.1.1.7 variant.	2021	03

2021-03-11 18:29:49	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079530866589708	18/ Overall, these results support a model of progressive immune dysfunction with advancing disease stage, with exhausted T cells and M2-like macrophages forming an ‚Äúimmune dysfunction circuit‚Äù in later disease stages https://t.co/zUpX6ego8I	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:48	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079527326658569	17/ We confirmed our findings in other publicly available datasets, in part using a gene signature for exhausted T cells ‚Äì TAM interactions. In multiple external cohorts, high expression of this interaction signature was associated with a worse prognosis, even within stage IV RCC https://t.co/X5YvMHqHrJ	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:47	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079522989703168	16/ We confirmed protein-level expression of these ligands and receptors using high-dimensional flow cytometry, and confirmed co-localization of these two immune populations in advanced disease using multiplex immunofluorescence https://t.co/cnHqb6RXVP	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:46	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079518224945155	15/ These exhausted CD8+ T cells and M2-like macrophages seemingly formed a bi-directional ‚Äúimmune dysfunction circuit‚Äù in more advanced disease stages https://t.co/B4HxPdMqSv	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:45	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079514357796865	14/ What were these interactions? The TAMs made ligands for T cell inhibitory receptors (supporting T cell exhaustion), and the exhausted CD8+ T cells made factors that support M2-like polarization of TAMs https://t.co/dMvxdzqfKQ	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:44	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079509626621953	13/ Exhausted CD8+ T cells and M2-like macrophages were both enriched in advanced disease stages, but did these cells talk to each other? We used #CellPhoneDB to infer cell-cell interactions, and inferred that these two populations did in fact communicate https://t.co/kQgof6UDAb	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:43	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079504656433153	12/ When we looked at the macrophage branch, those from advanced tumors were late in pseudotime, had an anti-inflammatory phenotype and expression of ‚ÄúM2-like‚Äù markers https://t.co/T1zx7anaqi	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:42	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079500709531652	11/ Macrophages can exist on a spectrum rather than in discrete states, so we again used trajectory analysis. An interesting pattern emerged ‚Äì classical monocytes branched into non-classical monocytes or into macrophages. There were clear differences between disease stages https://t.co/cn6bAYgrR4	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:41	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079496259436555	10/ We then turned our attention to the myeloid compartment. Here too, we found that M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were enriched in more advanced disease stages https://t.co/mMH1f4NkWD	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:40	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079492010606599	9/ Linking clonotype to phenotype, we found that exhausted CD8+ T cells (enriched in advanced disease stages) also had a more restricted TCR diversity https://t.co/Yw5r0aGzxE	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:39	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079487749193731	8/ Surprisingly, we found incredibly clonotype enrichment in some tumors. In one case, almost 50% of infiltrating T cells were all recognizing one target antigen. This is motivating our future work to uncover the relevant tumor antigens in RCC https://t.co/hrWY5H90Hv	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:38	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079483580067856	7/ Next, through single-cell paired alpha-beta TCR sequencing of over 60,000 infiltrating T cells, we described the TCR repertoire and clonotype-phenotype relationships https://t.co/lVUJ3hdl50	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:37	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079479217983491	6/ So what biological program was driving this trajectory? When we examined individual genes and gene programs, it became clear it was T cell exhaustion https://t.co/YueraiS9Ap	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:36	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079474356731905	5/ Further, trajectory inference analysis of CD8+ T cells produced a mostly linear trajectory. We again saw an interesting pattern ‚Äì CD8+ T cells from normal tissue and early stage ccRCC were early in pseudotime, and CD8+ T cells from more advanced disease were late in pseudotime https://t.co/cPqRLV0YnH	2021	03
2021-03-11 18:29:35	BraunMDPhD	990313941149548544	1370079470191788035	4/ We uncovered transcriptionally heterogeneous infiltrating T cell populations, but they separated into two main groups ‚Äì exhausted CD8+ T cells and non-exhausted T cells. In advanced disease stages, there was a substantially higher proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells https://t.co/mzrtdgrlo1	2021	03

2021-03-11 16:28:30	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370049000330657798	Read the full interview here: https://t.co/laySpSQO8J	2021	03
2021-03-11 16:28:30	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370048998606827522	We are depending on the world for everything and it‚Äôs not that we can‚Äôt produce, we just choose not to... It is frustrating when there is a solution but you can‚Äôt scale it up. I think our leaders prefer the option of importing because of the kickbacks that occur in the process.	2021	03
2021-03-11 16:28:29	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370048996920672260	We should recognize that investing in research is very critical to development. If we don‚Äôt do it,  who will? If there is anything to learn from COVID-19 pandemic, it is that Africa is over-reliant.	2021	03
2021-03-11 16:28:29	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370048995117178881	The vaccine has been presented on several platforms in this country and across the continent but has not been implemented simply because of our mindset.	2021	03
2021-03-11 16:28:27	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370048988464971778	The Diagnostic test that we developed in the Centre is used in the United States but not in Nigeria. The vaccine is almost at the stage of implementation in the UK yet we refuse to use our own product.	2021	03
2021-03-11 16:28:26	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370048983264071686	It is typical of Africans to believe that anything from western countries is better. The vaccine candidate we developed for COVID-19 is already undergoing clinical trials in UK. They are accepting it but our own government would not. And, that is why we are still under-developed.	2021	03
2021-03-11 16:28:26	acegid	1072136222716366848	1370048981229780998	On buying Covid-19 vaccines from foreign countries: It is the choice of the Country; it is the choice of Africans. Africans still live in their colonial minds; they don‚Äôt believe in themselves and what they can do. They believe so much in buying and importing.	2021	03

This could be worth billions. Unfortunately they have not been able to do it, and it does not seem to be on their strategy.	2021	03

It has the usual challenges though, as most of the information it provides, is not really actionable beyond the usual: eat healthy, stop smoking, maintain normal weight, use alcohol in moderation.	2021	03

The tech has potential for this, but they have really struggled with it, without any real successes beyond pilots.	2021	03

2021-03-02 10:14:56	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693496732717057	With news of poor uptake of Ox/AZ in EU and worries about vaccine snobbery over J&amp;J in USA, I think more countries should be looking to delay 2nd doses of the mRNA vaccines. It's a strategy that really looks smarter and smarter every day.	2021	03
2021-03-02 10:14:55	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693495692554240	But if you set the 2nd dose dates of all vaccines to be roughly similar (12 weeks in the UK case), then you lose a lot of the 'pickiness'. Regardless of the vaccine, you'll be around 80% protected in the immediate future and then 90% protected later in the year.	2021	03
2021-03-02 10:14:55	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693494639706112	All 3 vaccines, and the J&amp;J too are actually all very similar in protective effects after the one dose. What makes one seem better than others is really just the speed of getting 2nd dose. I can totally see why individuals would turn down J&amp;J or Ox/AZ in favour of an mRNA one.	2021	03
2021-03-02 10:14:55	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693493524021248	The 2nd reason is vaccine 'pickiness'. If you get Pfizer/BNT or Moderna in US or EU, you're getting both doses within weeks and on paper will be 90% protected in 5 to 6 weeks. For Ox/AZ you have to wait 12 weeks for dose 2 and so you're not up to 90% levels for 1/4 of a year.	2021	03
2021-03-02 10:14:55	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693492479709184	And with some proof now that vaccinations stop transmission, the more people vaccinated then the slower the spread of new cases. This first reason alone should be enough for other countries to consider this, but there's a second good reason too...	2021	03
2021-03-02 10:14:54	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693491091386371	The first is obvious... you can get vaccine into more people from the start, giving 80% protection to 2x people vs. 90+% to 1x people. This clearly looks very nice in world vaccination comparison graphs https://t.co/WO4JmK1oSG	2021	03
2021-03-02 10:14:54	ProfTomEllis	244431323	1366693488109223937	With lots of great real-world data now on the effectiveness of delayed 2nd vaccination dose, I'm kind of surprised other countries aren't immediately switching to the approach we have here in the UK. It has 2 very clear benefits.	2021	03

It is a shame to see this significant element overlooked in the article, with the focus on researchers rather than those whose day job it is to deliver PH 9/10	2021	03
2021-03-02 08:24:02	tomrconnor	2563237200	1366665586940461058	@K_G_Andersen @nature @arambaut @erikmvolz @EvolveDotZoo @CovidGenomicsUK Providing a service is more than developing new tools and providing infrastructure. These tools have to be production ready &amp; require effort to turn into accreditable services.

2021-03-02 06:55:10	KArandjelovic	1661736043	1366643224744366080	Two. The goal of vaccination is to reduce morbidity and mortality and preserve health system resources. We are watching the evidence-base evolve in real time, and the data is dynamic. But what the public needs is a message that is jargon-free, opinion-free and consistent.	2021	03
