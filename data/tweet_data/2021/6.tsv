I worry this will accumulate dirt/impurities, but it is the easiest to load w/ a nice droplet.

The Implen's cuvette cover is automatically retractable so it protects it but I think it's another thing to worry about breaking.	2021	06

The DeNovix comes in weird colors but in person it's really pretty and ergonomically the best. The OneC is tallest and a bit awkward to use.	2021	06

The current promos for all 3 from left to right is $11.2k, $9.2K (w/o fluorometer), and $10.5K. The OneC can't be haggled further but I think the others can.	2021	06

Overall it was a close race b/w DeNovix &amp; Implen, but I think the Implen just edges it out (if you don't count the DS-11 fluorometer feature). https://t.co/Bwhs99EM4B	2021	06

I really appreciate SPI-M and the transparency of their models. And ‚Ä¶ stop benchingmarking scenario models to data or *at least* indicate that it is a scenario	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:45	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906496895422470	(Eg ideally I‚Äôd like a better - lower granularity - geographic scenario model to my taste - as well cruder regional ones. But I‚Äôm not a scenario modeller and I appreciate the complexity of just getting a scenario model ‚Äúin zone‚Äù - meaning it will model reasonably existing data)	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:45	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906495461007361	Now - the counter factual in this is ‚Ä¶ hard and the appropriateness of the scenario model (what parameter combinations did they look at? What aspects of reality did they ignore?) is key. *plenty* to argue about	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:44	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906493997195276	This means ‚Ä¶ scenario models are *not there to be benchmarked to outcomes*. It‚Äôs not the ‚Ä¶ goal of these models. The goal is inform decision making so the question is better asked ‚Äúwas a good decision made with these models‚Äù.	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:44	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906492592066561	For scenario models often they are deliberately asked to use ‚Äúreasonable worse case‚Äù thinking - this English phrase has to be mapped to parameters and some parameters are not explored because they don‚Äôt impact the decision space too much	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:44	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906491266674690	And I am leaving out causal models (v useful when they can grip a problem) and deep learning (is it model? What has it learnt?).	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:43	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906489886674950	There are in some fields ‚Äúsimulation models‚Äù where the model of reality is good enough that running models with different configurations is meaningfully connected with error bars to reality. Not one for infectious epidemiology :)	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:43	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906488477388800	(No one - no one - can in their head work up what happens wuth exponential growth of x of infection but increasing vaccination of y at this age stratification. You need a model and computer to play around with ‚Ä¶ scenarios)	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:43	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906487043006465	Then there are scenario models. These are ‚Äúfor this necessarily crude model of reality what could happen in different scenarios‚Äù. These are not forecasts nor predictions; they help humans get their head around the complex decision space in front of them.	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:42	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906485646254086	Forecast models are still present (little coloured fans at the end of charts) but often don‚Äôt get much heat; not least because they are often quite good and then most ‚Äúhard‚Äù forecasts can‚Äôt go beyond 7 days or so	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:42	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906484266381314	Success here is twofold - how good is your prediction and - as important- how calibrated is your uncertainty - if you say 90% of the time the value shoukd within this range how often does this happen?	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:42	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906482647375874	Then there are forecast models; for this understanding - indeed sometimes a very agnostic view - can you predict what happens over the next 1,2, 4, 7 days? Indeed given laggy data can you accurately predict what‚Äôs today‚Äôs true numbers will be (so called ‚Äúnowcast‚Äù)	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:41	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906480906772490	Success here is making inferences of parameters which are robust - if you assign a value to a lineage it should be the same (given no GxE effect) elsewhere	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:41	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906479405129728	Interestingly one has variance aspects of these models to fit data but the variation is dealing with two things- ‚Äútrue‚Äù variance - from counts to random sampling process to variance between the mismatch between models and reality - eg all a local authority experiences the same	2021	06
2021-06-15 20:59:40	ewanbirney	183548902	1404906477471555584	These are the models I‚Äôm most familiar with - eg we observe these sequences, what is the most likely evolutionary history; we observe these case with these genomes in these places; what is the most likely growth rates attributable to the lineages	2021	06

2021-06-14 08:57:55	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362455736799232	Balancing when to have that final exit wave is going to be interesting and beyond the obvious - vaccinate as fast as possible - I think some care needs to taken on September/October, and the number of unvaccinated at risk people in each country then will be key.	2021	06
2021-06-14 08:57:55	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362454461726720	For Europe, it will be important to get to School holidays so that there is less mixing and more outdoor activity over the holidays before Delta rises (indeed, this much the strategy in the UK with the delay of 4 weeks).	2021	06
2021-06-14 08:57:55	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362453065011201	The differential transmission impact of 1st doses from Alpha to Delta is also going to be headache; countries that can easily control transmission of Alpha partly due to vaccination might find it far far harder to control Delta; Canada is particular at risk here.	2021	06
2021-06-14 08:57:54	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362451865440256	More complex is how Delta travels through the world.

2021-06-14 08:57:54	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362450477137923	I am less concerned though by the UK; the vaccination strategy works, the ability to see and quantify a new dangerous variant has happened, and an appropriate response looks in the works.	2021	06
2021-06-14 08:57:54	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362449319608321	A problem in communication here is going to be that there is going to be a number of people going to hospital over the summer with COVID in the UK, in any plan.

2021-06-14 08:57:54	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362447864139782	"It's worth stressing that *whenever* a country opens up fully (eg, Israel with B.1.1.7) there will be an ""exit wave"" and indeed one of the complications in the UK has been how much Delta vs how much stage 3 transmission change has occured over the last 4 weeks."	2021	06
2021-06-14 08:57:53	ewanbirney	183548902	1404362446727532548	This changes the calculus of how fast transmission will happen in the UK relative to vaccination rates, and because of this the UK Government looks likely to delay the final stage of reopening. This is ... sensible with far lower risks, and has paths ratcheting open.	2021	06

2021-06-02 12:25:55	dutchscientist	1620488732	1400066144283901965	The ICE was very nicely conserved, more than the 4 previously described CJIE1-4 Insertion Elements. We also checked the distribution of all five MGEs and the 3 major plasmid categories in the 7176 Campylobacter genomes (5829 jejuni and 1347 coli) 8/n	2021	06
2021-06-02 12:25:55	dutchscientist	1620488732	1400066143101063169	Firstly, the ICE contained 3 potential CRISPR arrays distributed over the ICE, rather than just one downstream of the cas genes. A tracrRNA was in the spacer array 30 kb upstream of cas9 . All of these spacer arrays were small, usually &lt;5 repeats (common for Campylobacter) 7/n	2021	06
2021-06-02 12:25:54	dutchscientist	1620488732	1400066141926703106	"We called this one CampyICE1. There were already examples of CRISPR-Cas on plasmids (type IV, some type I) and mobile genetic elements (Type I in Vibrio), but we could not find any examples of Type II Cas9 on a MGE. That was only the beginning of the ""unique"" features 6/n"	2021	06
2021-06-02 12:25:54	dutchscientist	1620488732	1400066140781658114	The new variant Cas9 clustered separately from other Campylobacter/Helicobacter Cas9 proteins.

2021-06-01 19:43:03	John_B_Cole	1618591	1399813765244362756	is a mess. The table of contents needs a lot of work to match the ABP style. Most of this is just cleanup, but it all takes time. Then I need to print the whole thing for blue pencil editing and decisions about the final typographic style. The latter will be a long process.	2021	06

2021-06-01 19:43:02	John_B_Cole	1618591	1399813761540763649	The tables (Step 8) are where things get hairy. The headers are often complex - they can be set in LaTeX, but I'm slow at it.

Step 7 is mostly cut-and-paste, but ABP used smallcaps to set all of the figure captions. That's not a common choice today.	2021	06

2021-06-01 19:43:01	John_B_Cole	1618591	1399813757828800514	Lush had his own style of writing, and he often used italics for emphasis.
